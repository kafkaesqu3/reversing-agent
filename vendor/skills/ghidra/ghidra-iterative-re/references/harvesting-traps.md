# Harvesting traps

*Reference for the `ghidra-iterative-re` skill. Only `SKILL.md` is loaded when the
skill is invoked; this file is read on demand when its trigger fires. New lessons of
this kind belong here, not in `SKILL.md`.*

**Read this when:** you are about to write or re-run a sweep, a probe, or anything that
reads evidence back out of the program — and before you believe a census, a zero, or a
reach estimate it produced.

**In this file:**

- Self-harvest and circular evidence
- Derivations, and repairing them at the source
- The instrument you read with
- Censuses, zeros and skip counters
- Calibrating and pricing a witness
- Undefined code and the byte-pattern engine
- Identity, joins and populations

### Self-harvest and circular evidence

- **The decompiler's signature is not necessarily the database's.** With no committed
  signature the decompiler applies local heuristics, so its display can differ from the
  Listing and *two call sites of the same function can show different signatures*.
  Reading a signature from decompiler output is not evidence it is in the database.
  `Commit Params/Return` commits it.
- **Harvesters are not idempotent across an apply.** The same harvester can legitimately
  yield different evidence afterward — a matcher for `T Func(...)` stops matching once an
  apply rewrites it. So: **stamp every evidence row with the program version it came
  from**, treat earlier evidence as **append-only**, and teach post-apply harvesters to
  accept the post-apply shape. Regenerating after an apply can silently drop whole
  witness categories while looking like a clean re-run.

- **The sharper version of that trap: the second run harvests *your own* output.** Stale
  evidence is the mild failure. The severe one is a harvester that re-reads names *this
  agent applied* and files them as findings — because those names then feed whatever
  decides the next apply, closing the loop on itself.

  It hides well for a structural reason: **a harvester written before any apply exists is
  correct when written, and only becomes circular the first time it is re-run after one.**
  Nothing changes in the harvester, no test fails, and the output looks richer than before.
  Measured here: re-running a slot-symbol sweep after a naming apply would have folded 8
  agent-applied names back into the very file feeding the calibration gate and the naming
  rule — i.e. into the inputs deciding what to name next.

  So the `SourceType.AI` exclusion is not a property you add once to "the harvesters" — it
  is a property every harvester needs *before its second run*. Audit them at the moment the
  round's first apply lands, not when they are written. Treat an agent-sourced name as
  **identical to no name at all**: absent from evidence, and still an open candidate. Then
  assert it: after any re-harvest, check that every address in your applied-names ledger
  comes back unnamed in the fresh evidence, and fail if one does not.

  **The oldest harvester is the most dangerous one**, and it is worth naming that explicitly
  because it inverts the intuition that old code is safe. The sweep that ran first, before
  any apply existed, is the one whose author had no reason to write the filter — so it is
  both the most trusted artifact in the project and the only one with no protection. Measured
  on a second occasion here, years of rounds later: the original vtable sweep was regenerated
  and **578 of 578** changed function names joined, *by address*, to the agent's own applied-
  names ledger — 0 from any other source. The committed artifact was found to have already
  captured 8 such names from an earlier round. **Join by address, never by name**, or the
  audit itself inherits the collision problem below.
- **A producer whose CLASSIFICATION INPUT is derived from its own output is self-harvesting,
  there is no `SourceType` tier to filter on, and you fix it at the DERIVATION rather than by
  loosening the gate.** The self-harvest rule above is about
  *symbols*; this is the same failure on the **artifact** axis, where the only defence is
  arithmetic. Shape: sweep S writes artifact A; derivation D folds A into artifact B; S reads
  B to decide what is new. Measured: a destructor-chain witness classified its claims against
  a hierarchy file built from its own edges, and on the second run its two contradictions had
  become agreements *with itself* — agreement counters up by exactly the folded edges
  (100/209 → 101/210), contradictions **2 → 0**, and every gate green for the wrong reason.
  Three things do it, and the third is the one that actually catches it:
  - **Design the artifact so the pre-fold view is RECONSTRUCTIBLE.** Record, per row, what the
    value used to be (`superseded_base`) and which entities the fold created. A fold you
    cannot undo on paper is one you cannot audit.
  - **Subtract your own previous output at load, then classify — and PRINT that you did it.**
    A silent subtraction is as unauditable as a silent fold.
  - **The vacuity guard is what catches this, not any value check.** Nothing here was
    "wrong": no count mismatched, no artifact drifted. The only thing that fired was the
    selftest arm asserting there was still a contradiction available to poison with. A
    self-harvesting producer fails by having its findings quietly go to zero while every
    other number *improves*, so a census selftest without a vacuity arm cannot see it.
- **N-OF-N AGREEMENT IS WORTH NOTHING WHEN ONE SIDE WAS APPLIED FROM THE OTHER — AND IT IS THE
  MOST PERSUASIVE-LOOKING NUMBER YOU WILL PRODUCE.** Measured: a probe found **43 of 43** names
  in a property registrar matching the field names on the recovered structs exactly. Read as an
  independent witness confirming the layouts, that is a striking corroboration. It is
  tautological: the applier that built those structs *reads that registry*. This is the
  self-harvest rule on the ARTIFACT axis, where no `SourceType` tier exists to filter on, so the
  only defence is provenance and arithmetic — before recording any agreement as evidence, ask
  **"would this cell hold this value if we had applied nothing?"** and name the producer on each
  side. A perfect score is the shape to distrust first.
- **"NO EVIDENCE SOURCE EXISTS FOR THIS" IS A RESULT, AND BELONGS IN THE RECORD AS ONE.** A
  layout round can recover offsets and widths for thousands of cells and still have no source
  anywhere that could NAME them. Measured: of every committed artifact carrying both an offset and
  a name, exactly one had a class column intersecting the recovered population at all — reaching
  16 of 198 classes, whose names were already applied. So 182 classes and ~3750 fields have no
  naming source in the project. Left as a task on an open list, "name the fields" reads as
  available work forever and gets re-derived every few rounds; recorded as a measurement, with the
  sources checked and what would change the answer, it stops costing anything.
### Derivations, and repairing them at the source

- **Two identical branches of an `if`/`else` are a silent UNDER-REPORT, not dead code.** Where
  you wrote a branch to express a distinction and both arms do the same thing, the distinction
  is simply unmeasured — and the output still looks like a working measurement with a small
  answer. Measured: a probe meant to treat "the class's own store survived" and "it was
  elided" differently emitted the same pairs in both cases, so an entire claim category went
  untested and single-element chains produced nothing at all. Repairing it moved that arm from
  unmeasured to 209 agreements and 1 contradiction. Diff the arms of any `if`/`else` you wrote
  for a reason.
- **A calibration gate on a witness that may legitimately STRENGTHEN must be a FLOOR, not an
  equality.** The failure worth catching is the witness going *quiet*; an equality additionally
  fails every time the program legitimately grows, which trains the reader to re-baseline it.
- **Do not MERGE the artifact you are using as an independent cross-check.** A new witness
  agreeing with an unrelated artifact 30 of 30 is worth more as a standing corroboration than
  as 29 extra rows — folding them makes the two agree by construction and destroys the
  measurement that justified the witness in the first place. Independence is a property you
  spend when you merge.
- **A pipeline that derives wrong and patches afterwards violates this rule from the
  inside, and it hides for years.** The version everyone catches is a one-off hand edit.
  The version nobody catches is a *second script* that corrects the first one's output as
  a routine pipeline step: the committed artifact is correct, every consumer is happy, and
  the derivation stays broken. Measured: a vtable sweep labelled each table by its slot-0
  function's namespace and a separate script overwrote that with honest labels afterwards
  — so a plain run of the sweep produced a file naming **29746 of 31341 rows after a
  single base class**, 95% of it wrong, and the stability harness (which runs sweeps, not
  post-steps) reported ~29700 drifting cells on every pass until someone read them. Test
  for it directly: **run each producer alone and ask whether its output is the committed
  artifact.** If a second step is required to make it honest, the artifact is not
  derivable and the fix belongs in the producer — after which the post-step should be
  retired to a no-op you assert stays a no-op.
- **Fix a wrong artifact at its DERIVATION, not by patching the rows.** When a defect in
  committed evidence is proven, the tempting round is to amend the data — it is smaller,
  and the diff is reviewable. But a patched artifact stops being re-derivable, which is the
  property that made it evidence; the producing rule stays wrong; and the next regeneration
  silently reintroduces the whole defect. Measured here: a boundary rule that mistook a
  constant-propagated virtual-call reference for a table start had forged 7 tables. Patching
  the 55 affected rows and fixing the rule cost the same effort — the rule fix also fixed
  the *next* regeneration, and turned the 7 known cases into a live calibration gate.
- **Separate program drift from the change under test, or you cannot read the diff.**
  Re-running a harvester that was written many rounds ago never reproduces its committed
  output, because the program has moved underneath it — so "regenerate and diff" conflates
  two entirely different populations of change. Run the **old** rule first and diff *that*
  against the committed artifact (pure drift, adjudicated alone), then diff the **new** rule
  against the old rule's fresh output (your change, and nothing else). Keep the old rule
  reachable behind an argument for exactly this. Here the naive one-step diff showed ~29748
  rows changed and was unreadable; the two-step version resolved it into "a post-processing
  step I had forgotten to apply", "578 rows of self-harvested names" (above), and finally
  the **55 rows** the change was actually supposed to make.
### The instrument you read with

- **A p-code harvester must state its simplification style, and calibrate across two —
  but read `buildDefaultGroups()` before choosing which two.**
  `DecompInterface.setSimplificationStyle` takes `decompile` (default), `normalize`,
  `firstpass`, `paramid`, `register`. The default style runs a rule called **`earlyremoval`
  that deletes COPY operations whose output has no descendant — including stack writes
  rendered dead by a function signature, whether or not that signature is correct.** For a
  project whose layout evidence is "which offsets does this constructor write", that would
  be a silent under-count arriving from inside the tool, possibly caused by a signature
  *you* applied.

  **An earlier revision of this document said to compare `normalize` against `decompile` to
  expose it. That is wrong, measured against a 12.1.2 install**, and it is worth stating
  loudly because the advice looks obviously right:

  ```
  coreaction.cc:5563   actdead->addRule( new RuleEarlyRemoval("deadcode") );
  ```

  and `ActionDatabase::buildDefaultGroups()` lists `"deadcode"` in the member arrays of
  **both** `decompile` and `normalize`. That comparison holds the named rule constant. The
  only shipped styles omitting `deadcode` are **`register`** (`base`, `analysis`, `subvar`)
  and **`firstpass`** (`base` alone) — so `register` is the style that actually tests
  `earlyremoval`, and `firstpass` is the control that shows what the analysis was buying.
  What `normalize` really omits is **`typerecovery`**, which is a different and often more
  interesting question: it is the group that consumes *the types you applied*.

  **Generalise past the specific fact:** `buildDefaultGroups()` is the ground truth for
  what a style runs. The javadoc's one-line descriptions ("omits type recovery and some of
  the final clean-up steps") do not say which rules move, and a round planned from them
  targets the wrong comparison — burning the round's whole budget on a comparison that was
  never capable of firing.

  Measured on one project, over the 14 array-loop candidates behind its only exact size
  witness: `decompile`, `normalize` and `register` each decided all **12** strides with
  **identical values**; `firstpass` decided 1. Zero contradictions, zero cases of a
  less-processed style deciding where the default declined. A real answer, and cheap — but
  only because the comparison was picked from the groups rather than from the prose.

- **An instruction-level harvester that accepts only IMMEDIATE operands under-counts exactly
  where the compiler HOISTS a repeated constant into a register — and the blanks look like a
  property of the data.** A string-registration parser read `MOV [reg+8], imm` and missed
  `MOV EDI, "float"` loaded once per body and stored from the register per record: 49 of 83
  type cells came back blank, every one of them `float`, every `int` captured — a pattern
  that invites a story about the API ("only ints are typed") rather than about the reader.
  Before theorising about a blank census, compare ONE body against the decompiler's view of
  it; then fix it at the derivation, keep the old arm reachable behind an argument, and run
  every consumer through the old-vs-committed / new-vs-old two-step diff (here: 0 drift, then
  exactly 4 evidence cells and 0 decided-layout rows). Track register loads with the same
  invalidation discipline as an alias tracker: any write to the register drops it, a CALL
  drops the caller-saved set, the callee-saved registers survive — which is precisely why the
  compiler parks the hoisted strings there.
- **Measure the decompiler-derived SURFACE before auditing it.** The audit above was queued
  on the premise that the project's layout witnesses were harvested from decompiler output.
  One census — *which scripts construct a `DecompInterface`* — refuted it: every write-set
  witness read raw instructions through `listing.getInstructions()`, and the entire
  decompiler-derived evidence surface was **one function**. A p-code simplification rule
  cannot perturb a witness that never asks for p-code. The premise had sat unchallenged in a
  queued round for a week, and it cost one command to check.

  **QUALIFIED, and the qualification is the more useful half: "not the decompiler" is not the
  same as "not p-code", and there are THREE levels here, not two.** Reading raw instructions
  does insulate a witness from simplification rules — and if it reads
  `getDefaultOperandRepresentation()`, it buys that insulation by throwing away the
  instruction's SEMANTICS, which is a worse trade than it looks:

  | level | what it is | carries direction? | simplification rules? |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | rendered operand text | `getDefaultOperandRepresentation()` + a regex | **no** | no |
  | **raw instruction p-code** | **`Instruction.getPcode()` — the SLEIGH spec itself** | **yes** | **no** |
  | decompiler p-code | `HighFunction` / `DecompInterface` | yes | yes |

  The middle row is the one projects skip, and it is strictly better than the first: same
  insulation, plus the processor specification's own account of what the instruction does.
  Measured: a write-set witness parsed operand 0 with a regex and recorded it as a WRITE,
  because operand 0 is the destination for `MOV`. It is a **source** for `CMP`, `TEST`, `FLD`,
  `FMUL` and every x87 memory form — so **1552 of 21249 committed `ctor_write` rows (7.3%),
  across 151 of 198 classes, were reads**. Nothing failed; the offsets were real, the sizes
  they bounded were right (a read of `this+K` proves K is inside the object exactly as a store
  does), and only the LABEL was false. `getPcode()` containing a `STORE` op answers the
  direction question authoritatively, because it *is* the processor's definition.

  Two riders, both measured on that repair:

  - **Do not hand-write the mnemonic list.** The first attempt at the fix was a
    `READ_OP0 = {CMP, TEST, PUSH, FLD, ...}` set typed from memory. Graded against the SLEIGH
    answer on the same instructions it **disagreed on 70 of 2221**. This is the skill's own
    "discover the API from the install, not from memory" rule pointed at instruction semantics,
    where it is easier to fall for because the mnemonics feel like common knowledge.
  - **A relabel moves evidence in BOTH directions — measure both before predicting the net.**
    The repair was expected to *reduce* corroboration, since some cells were corroborated by a
    write that turned out to be a read: 8 such rows were counted, and a drop was predicted.
    The actual result was a **rise, 317 → 347**, because the mislabel had been *collapsing two
    independent witness kinds under one name* and hiding corroboration at far more cells than
    it invented it at — **570 cells gained** a distinct kind against **41** that lost one. The
    prediction was wrong because only the loss direction had been counted, which is exactly the
    half-measurement this document demands a counter for when a rule changes.

- **Do NOT test whether a witness depends on types you applied by withholding an opcode
  downstream of type recovery.** Same project, same round: the exact-size witness read
  multiplier constants from `INT_MULT` inputs and `PTRADD` element sizes, and `PTRADD`'s
  constant is the size of a pointed-to type — i.e. of a struct the project itself applied.
  Withholding `PTRADD` lost **9 of 12** strides, which reads as "9 exact sizes rest on our
  own applied types". **False.** `RulePtrArith` (group `typerecovery`) *consumes* the
  `INT_MULT` it folds into the `PTRADD`, so withholding the `PTRADD` removes the only
  surviving copy of a constant that was never type-derived; at `normalize`, with
  `typerecovery` off, the identical constants return as `INT_MULT` and all 12 decide. Turn
  the **type recovery** off and re-measure. An opcode-withholding test is invalid wherever
  the analysis consumes the alternative form — and note which way it failed: it
  *manufactured* a serious finding rather than hiding one.
- **Your own markup perturbs similarity witnesses.** Ghidra's BSim tutorial warns that
  applying debug information changes BSim signatures and can degrade matching — so a
  correlation run *after* an apply round is not measuring the same thing as one before it.
  Capture similarity evidence early, or record which program version it came from.
### Censuses, zeros and skip counters

- **Distinguish measured-zero from structural-zero.** "I looked and found nothing" and
  "there was nothing to look at" are different findings. Emit counters that separate them.
  **Print the zeros**: a census listing only the kinds that fired cannot be told apart
  from one where a kind is dead, so enumerate every expected witness kind with its count
  including `0`, and say which zeros are known limitations of the scanner.
- **An artifact derived from an EXTERNAL input must name that input beside it, and a
  regeneration must be checked against the named input — diff MAGNITUDE is the tell.** A
  comparison against an external oracle was regenerated with the wrong one of two archived
  oracle outputs; the mistake announced itself as a diff in which the ORACLE-side columns
  moved — something the change under test structurally could not do — and at ~20× the
  expected size. Before adjudicating any regeneration diff, ask which columns the change
  could possibly touch; a diff outside that set is an input-identity failure, not a
  finding.
- **A MAXIMAL PRINTABLE RUN IS NOT A STRING — sweep its SUFFIXES, or a string whose
  neighbour ends in a printable byte is invisible.** A C string's END is observable (the
  NUL is what the program itself uses); its START is not — a string simply begins wherever
  the previous datum stopped. So a string sweep built on `[\x20-\x7e]{n,}` silently prefixes
  every name whose preceding constant happens to end printable, and no token split on
  non-alphanumerics recovers it. Measured on one binary: two class names went unrecovered
  for eleven rounds and were written up as *"no string anywhere in the install hashes to
  either"* — a **measured zero that was a defect in the reader**, the same family as the
  immediate-operand under-count above. The donors were ordinary float constants:
  `255.0f` = `00 00 7f 43` ends in `'C'`, `1024.0f` = `00 00 80 44` ends in `'D'`, so
  `CRendScaledFont` and `CSimpleAnimation` were swept as `CCRendScaledFont` and
  `DCSimpleAnimation` — one byte long, hashing to nothing, in four separate DLLs. Yield each
  run's bounded suffixes as well (a 4-byte datum contributes at most 3 printable bytes
  before the run breaks, so a skip bound of 4 covers it). Three follow-ups, all cheap:
  - **The same widening usually feeds a MEASURED ZERO somewhere else, so measure it before
    landing it.** Here the dictionary also carried a "of 588 unresolved ids, exactly one is
    the hash of any string in the install" claim, and a single accidental collision would
    have reopened it. A standalone probe over 6,034,721 runs, run before the edit: the
    skip-0 arm reproduced the old result exactly and the skip-1..4 arm added **zero** ids —
    2.49M → 4.67M distinct strings for the identical zero, i.e. the claim got *stronger*.
    Had the probe come back non-zero, the honest outcome was a recorded cost, not a
    quietly-unwidened sweep.
  - **Require the NUL when you match.** Matching a name as a bare substring is exactly what
    the trap defeats; `name + b"\x00"` is the boundary the distortion cannot fake.
  - **Retract the old claim IN PLACE, and retire the lead it spawned.** The wrong zero had
    grown a follow-up ("their registrars are the best lead, look in this code blob") that
    was never needed — the answer was in a different binary the whole time. A stale lead
    reads as an opportunity forever; strike it where a reader will meet it.
- **A GUARD THAT COMPARES ADDRESSES WHERE IT MEANS VALUES discards whole bodies the moment
  the compiler duplicates a tail.** The conservative rule "the last relevant write in this
  function must be one my tracker attributed, or nothing here is trustworthy" is correct.
  Expressing it as *"last-tracked-write **location** == last-write-of-any-kind
  **location**"* is not. Measured: a compiler duplicated a factory's epilogue across a branch
  instead of joining it, emitting two identical writes of the same value; the register-restore
  instruction between them legitimately kills the tracker, so the second write is seen but
  unattributed — two locations, one value, and the guard threw the entire function away.
  Six exact class sizes were absent from every artifact for months, reported honestly as
  `skipped: no_tracked_construction=6`. The sibling class whose branches merged *before* the
  write had been decided exactly, and sat in the same file.

  Compare the VALUE: every relevant write from the last attributed one onward must carry the
  same value. Three things make that a repair rather than a loosening, and all three are
  cheap:
  - **Assert the direction.** State whether the new rule is strictly weaker or strictly
    stronger and make the probe *count the other direction and raise*. Here a
    `REGRESSIONS (old True → new False)` counter asserted **0**, with an example address in
    the exception. "12 rows changed" alone cannot tell a repair from a hole.
  - **Measure reach over the FIRE POPULATION, not the cases in hand.** The guard had five
    consumers, one of them a mutating applier that the read-only stability harness is blind
    to by construction, so proving the six known cases proved nothing about the rest. Both
    rules were run over every function under every seeding the consumers use — 11248
    body/seeding pairs — and exactly 12 moved.
  - **Point the probe at the PRODUCTION implementation once the rule lands.** Written with
    two local copies of the rule it is a one-off; extracting the rule into the library and
    having the probe call it for both settings turns the same hand-built arms into a standing
    regression test on the shipped code.
- **A SKIP COUNTER is a to-do list, not a footnote — and an absent ROW hides better than a
  blank CELL.** This document already says to print the zeros and to suspect the reader
  before theorising about a blank census. The sharper failure is one rung up: a sweep that
  honestly prints `skipped: no_tracked_construction=6` beside 196 successes, and a decider
  that honestly reports those 6 as "no upper bound". Nothing is hidden and nothing is
  wrong — yet the six classes are absent from the artifact *entirely*, so no census of it
  can see them, and the project's narrative silently became "nothing allocates these"
  (a story about the DATA) when the truth was one line of reader limitation. Measured: all
  six were allocated by an ordinary factory whose `PUSH 0x230` sat twelve bytes before the
  call, and reading ONE of those factories by hand produced six exact class sizes that a
  purpose-built witness round had failed to reach. **Treat every non-zero skip counter as
  a queued item with an owner, and read one skipped case by hand before believing any
  conclusion drawn over the survivors.** A blank cell at least appears in the census; a
  dropped row does not appear anywhere.
- **A CALL TO A BASE CONSTRUCTOR IS NOT AN ALLOCATION OF THE BASE — AND THE MISLABEL PRINTS A
  PLAUSIBLE, PRECISE, WRONG SIZE.** Asking *"is class X ever allocated on its own?"* as *"is there
  an allocation whose object is handed to X's constructor?"* is the natural phrasing and it is
  wrong under single inheritance: a descendant's factory allocates the DESCENDANT and calls the
  base constructor on the same pointer. Measured, on a class bounded [452, 496]: the probe
  answered **2 direct allocations, of 676 and 496 bytes** — which are exactly the two descendants'
  sizes — and printed *"DIRECT ALLOCATIONS of AIUnit -> 676 bytes"*, a confident wrong size for
  the very class the round existed to size. **Classify each allocation against the known
  descendant sizes before attributing it to the base.** Note the direction of the failure: it
  MANUFACTURES a finding rather than hiding one, which is the direction that gets believed.
- **A CLASS'S VTABLE IS NOT ITS POPULATION — IT IS ONLY THE VIRTUAL HALF.** A per-class witness
  built from vtable slot targets silently omits the constructor and every non-virtual member,
  which are compiled as the class and are exactly as good a witness. Measured: a size probe
  scanned 4 slot targets, found nothing above offset 88, and was one step from recording a
  measured zero over a population that **excluded the constructor which had produced the class's
  existing lower bound of 452**. Widening to slots + constructor + namespace members + bodies
  taking a `Class *` this-parameter moved the highest observed access from **88 to 452** — and
  that jump is the check that the widening reached the right code rather than merely more of it.
  Before believing any per-class census, ask whether its population is the CLASS or just its
  vtable.
- **MEASURE A NEGATIVE FROM BOTH DIRECTIONS, THEN RETIRE THE LEAD EXPLICITLY.** "This class's own
  bodies never reach past K" is half an answer; the other half is whether its DESCENDANTS write
  below their own start, which would move the boundary the other way. Both came back zero, which
  turned an earlier round's prose claim — *"nothing observes those 44 bytes"* — into a
  measurement. Then **say the lead is exhausted, name the routes that were run, and name the
  evidence that would still settle it** (here a runtime observation at the descendant's factory,
  recorded at its own provenance tier since it is a fact about one execution). A stale "unknown"
  reads as an opportunity forever, and the next round will otherwise re-derive the same negative.
- **PRICING THE NEXT ROUND IS A REVIEW OF THE LAST ONE — POINT THE PRICING PROBE AT LAST
  ROUND'S ARTIFACT WITH A DIFFERENT QUESTION, BECAUSE IT CATCHES WHAT THE GATES STRUCTURALLY
  CANNOT.** This document already says to price a queued round against the program
  because a plan's premises decay. The other half is that the pricing probe is the first thing to
  look at last round's ARTIFACT with a different question, which makes it the cheapest review you
  will ever get. Measured: a layout round shipped with its tiling guard passing on every class,
  its re-derivation calibration at 198/198 and an outside-route calibration at 500/500 — all
  green, all correct, and all blind. The next round's apply census then printed a stratum named
  *"fields start at 0"* whose members had a recorded base, and **a class with a base cannot own
  byte 0; that is its base's vptr.** The guards were checking internal consistency; only the
  census asked what the rows MEANT. Two things generalise:
  - **A FALLBACK THAT DEGRADES SILENTLY TO ZERO WILL BE READ AS A MEASUREMENT.** The boundary
    computation fell back to "how far did our own walk of the base reach", which is legitimately 0
    for a base outside the walked population — so one value meant both *"this class genuinely
    starts at 0"* and *"we have no idea where its base ends"*. 33 of 99 classes, **79% of the
    field rows**, took the second path while being reported as the first. Make a fallback chain
    record WHICH RUNG it landed on, as a value in the row: here `base_sizeof` /
    `base_ctor_write_max` / `base_observed_extent` / `base_unmeasured`. Same family as
    "distinguish measured-zero from structural-zero", one level down — inside a derivation rather
    than in a census.
  - **WHEN THE ROWS ARE RIGHT AND THE LABEL IS WRONG, ADD THE LABEL; DO NOT DELETE THE ROWS.**
    Excluding the affected classes or blanking their fields would have discarded 2839 correct
    observations — every cell was a real access to a real byte of the object. What was false was
    the claim that they were the class's OWN storage. A `scope` column repaired it, and the
    reclassified rows turned out to be the MOST useful for the apply that follows, because they
    already cover `[0, sizeof)`.
- **A SUMMARY LINE THAT AVERAGES TWO POPULATIONS IS WRONG EVEN WHEN EVERY ROW IN IT IS RIGHT.**
  The same round reported "27603 of 50468 own bytes = 54.7%", arithmetic over a mixture of
  own-storage and whole-object rows. Split, the two real figures are **35.8%** and **58.9%** —
  and the headline sat between them, resembling both and describing neither. Before reporting a
  ratio, ask whether its denominator means ONE thing; this is the reporting analogue of the
  vacuity guard, and it fails in the direction that looks most like success.
- **AND THE SKIP COUNTER CAN BE A FINDING WEARING A FAILURE'S CLOTHES — SPLIT THE PREDICATE
  BEFORE BELIEVING THE COUNT.** The rule above says to treat a non-zero skip counter as a queued
  item. The sharper case is where the counter is not a limitation at all. Measured: a layout
  producer refused 99 classes on `sizeof(base) >= sizeof(class)`, sound reasoning because a base
  at least as large as its derived class contradicts containment. Every one of the 99 was
  **equality, and none was strictly larger** — the ordinary behaviour-only subclass, which
  overrides virtuals and adds no data members. Printed as "99 skipped" that reads as the tool
  failing; the truth was *99 classes proven to add no fields*, established by two independently
  derived sizes (each class's own allocation, and the base's own artifact). One `>=` had
  collapsed a finding and a contradiction into a single bucket, and the finding was the larger
  half. Whenever a guard's condition is a comparison, ask what each side of the boundary means
  separately — this is the "absent row hides better than a blank cell" failure moved one level
  up, into the PREDICATE rather than the reader, where no census of the output can see it.
### Calibrating and pricing a witness

- **A RANKING TELLS YOU WHERE TO LOOK AND NEVER WHAT YOU WILL FIND — SO A READ-IT-BY-HAND ROUND
  CANNOT BE PRICED BEFORE SOME OF IT HAS BEEN READ.** A pricing probe over a ranked list sees only
  the columns it computed — address, size, call count — and those columns are blind to the one thing
  that decides the round's cost: whether the population has a SHAPE. Measured: a fan-in ranking of
  unnamed functions was priced as *"25–50 bodies, no mechanical rule, a hand-read round"*, which was
  an honest reading of what the ranking showed. Nine bodies later the head was **dominated by
  constructors and destructors**, which carry the most exact class evidence in the binary — the
  address the code writes into `[this+0]` **is** the class, an instruction operand rather than an
  inference. The rule was there the whole time; the ranking could not display it.

  Two consequences worth acting on:
  - **Read a handful before quoting a price.** Five to ten bodies is cheap next to scoping a round
    around "no mechanical rule" and then discovering one — or worse, budgeting for a mechanical rule
    that is not there.
  - **Then write the producer that re-derives what the reading found**, so the population is
    checkable rather than a claim about what somebody noticed. The reading supplies the hypothesis;
    the producer supplies the census. Neither substitutes for the other.

  The same asymmetry runs the other way: a ranking that looks *promising* can price a route that
  does not exist. Pricing is a claim about a population, and a claim about a population needs a
  sample.

- **CALIBRATE A NEW LAYOUT WITNESS ON THE BASE SUBOBJECTS IT ALREADY WALKS THROUGH — IT IS A FREE
  OUTSIDE ROUTE — AND PARTITION THE RESULT INTO THREE BUCKETS, NOT TWO.** Any construction-chain
  or member-access witness for a derived class necessarily crosses its base subobjects, so
  wherever some *other* machinery has already laid out one of those bases you have a graded
  population for nothing, produced by a route the new witness does not consume. Measured: five
  such bases covered 51 classes, giving **500 cells inside a committed field, 0 straddling a
  committed boundary, 2423 in a committed gap**. Three things make it a real calibration:
  - **The gap bucket must be reported and NOT graded.** A cell landing where the older artifact
    claims nothing is neither agreement nor contradiction; folding it into either side corrupts
    the measure, and it is usually the biggest bucket — here 2423 against 500. It is the
    *payload*: the new witness reaching where the old one did not.
  - **Require agreement, not merely absence of contradiction.** A zero `inside` count must raise.
    Otherwise a witness that is systematically misaligned — every cell landing in gaps — passes
    with a clean sheet.
  - **Put the arm BEFORE the write and poison it on real data.** Shifting one cell two bytes per
    gradeable class fires it (`7 cell(s) straddle`), and because the check sits between the
    harvest and the emit, the poisoned run leaves no artifact to revert. That is the "a run that
    RAISED must not have its output promoted" rule solved by ORDERING instead of by cleanup, and
    it is strictly better because it cannot be forgotten.
- **A REDUCING OPERATION IS WHERE AN EVIDENCE SET GOES TO DIE — READ WHAT YOUR SWEEPS DISCARD,
  NOT ONLY WHAT THEY EMIT.** The skip-counter rule above is about rows a sweep declined to
  produce. This is the case where the sweep *did* the work, on the *whole* population, and
  threw the result away one line later. Measured: a body scanner tracked every store through a
  register its alias tracker resolved to the object, computed `offset + width` for each, and
  kept only the **maximum**, committed as a scalar `ctor_write_max`. 125 of the 133 classes in
  the project's next open lead carried that row — so 125 complete per-offset write sets had been
  measured and discarded, round after round, while a new sweep was being designed to obtain
  exactly them. Two things make this worth a standing check rather than an anecdote:
  - **The reducer's own artifact proves the traversal already reaches the population.** A
    committed `max`, `count` or `any` column is a receipt saying *"this code visited every one of
    these and looked at the quantity you now want"*. Grep your producers for `max(`, `+= 1` and
    early `break` before scoping any round that proposes to go and measure something.
  - **Recovering it is ADDITIVE and must be proven so, not argued so.** Append the cells at the
    exact site that already computes the reduced value, so no existing key's value can move —
    then run the stability harness anyway, because "this cannot have changed anything" is the
    reasoning this document refuses everywhere else. Here: 47 producers, 0 raised, 0 CHANGED and 55
    version-only restamps across 96 artifacts.
- **PRICE A PROPOSED WITNESS IN COVERAGE, NEVER IN SPAN — AND A ONE-EXAMPLE CAVEAT IS NOT A
  MEASUREMENT.** "Measure a proposed mechanism's REACH before building it" has a unit, and
  picking the wrong one flatters the round. Measured on the same population: the committed
  high-water marks reach a median **31.9%** of each class's size, which reads like a workable
  layout; the bytes those same writes actually **cover** are **2.3%**, because one store far out
  produces a large maximum and a tiny footprint. Span is an upper bound on coverage and the gap
  between them is the entire question. The sibling witness failed the same way in the other
  direction: a previous round had called its tiling "sparse" on the strength of one example, and
  over the whole population it covers **2.7%** of bytes with 106 of 133 classes under 5% — the
  difference between "supplement it" and "it cannot carry the round".
- **A CONSTRUCTION WRITE SET IS A PROPERTY OF THE CHAIN, NOT OF THE BODY — FOLLOW THE CALLS
  WHOSE RECEIVER THE SCAN RESOLVED TO THE OBJECT, AND READ THE QUIET RESULT AS THE TELL RATHER
  THAN AS A BROKEN TRACKER.** `references/cpp-abi.md` says a vptr-store chain names ancestors because MSVC
  deletes unobservable stores. The layout consequence is the same mechanism read forward: MSVC
  emits a derived constructor as `call base_ctor; mov [this], own_vftable`, so essentially all
  field initialisation lives in the **base's** body. A flat per-body write set therefore reports
  **one** tracked cell on a 936-byte class, which reads as a broken tracker and is not. Follow
  the calls whose receiver the scan resolved to the object — delta-0 by construction, so sound
  under single inheritance — depth-capped and cycle-guarded: coverage went **5.0% → 69.8%**,
  median **77.6%** per class, 78 of 125 classes above 75%. Two riders:
  - **Another artifact usually already records WHY the witness was quiet.** The size artifact's
    witness column read `ancestor:ctor_write_max` for most of this population: the size was known
    to be inherited, therefore so were the fields. Nobody had put the two side by side. When a
    witness comes back surprisingly quiet, search your own artifacts for the explanation before
    theorising about the tracker or the data.
  - **Say what the coverage number is NOT.** It is bytes touched by an observed construction-time
    access — offsets and widths — not fields identified, typed or named; and the chain admits
    non-constructor callees on purpose, because a write through `this` proves the cell is in the
    object whoever emitted it. Splitting those bytes between a class and its bases is a separate
    step with its own rule.
- **Diminishing returns in one vein is a signal to change AXIS, not to push harder, and the
  trigger is measurable.** When a round costs a full apply-and-verify cycle to decide four
  bytes, and the residue is a handful of items each needing its own bespoke witness, that
  population is exhausted *for that method* — the remaining information is somewhere else.
  Cheap axis changes that repay: rank functions by CALL-SITE FAN-IN rather than by class
  membership (measured: the two highest-fan-in unnamed functions in one binary were the
  game's own allocator and its free, 905 call sites between them, invisible to every
  class-oriented view and already sitting in a script constant, unapplied); ask what a
  thing IS rather than how big it is; and look at the populations no route reaches at all.
  The point is not that breadth beats depth — it is that a stalled depth metric is
  evidence about your METHOD, not about the binary.
- **Before extending a rule to a new evidence source, compare what the RULE requires against
  what the evidence already proved — the extension is often free, and if it is not, that is
  the moment to stop.** Measured: a containment rule (`sizeof(base) <= sizeof(descendant) <=
  alloc(descendant)`) needed only ANCESTRY, while the evidence it was being offered — edges
  from a destructor-chain witness — had already cleared a strictly *higher* bar (immediacy)
  to be recorded at all. So it qualified *a fortiori*: no new soundness argument, no new
  calibration design, one row changed and a class went from an open interval to an exact
  size. The round was short precisely because that comparison was made first instead of the
  argument being re-derived from scratch. The same question asked the other way is the stop
  signal: when the new use needs MORE than the evidence proved, do not extend — that is a new
  witness wearing an old rule's clothes.
  - **Re-run the rule's calibration over the COMBINED population, and demonstrate it firing
    THERE.** A calibration that only ever sees the original evidence passes vacuously on the
    new. Here the poison had to point a *fabricated new-source edge* at a known-size base to
    prove the check reached the added rows at all.
  - **Give the ground-truth arm a NEGATIVE TWIN, and assert its diff is exactly the expected
    size.** A flag that re-runs the decider *without* the new evidence must fail to reach the
    result, and the two runs must differ in exactly the rows claimed. Otherwise "the value is
    now pinned" is a fact about the artifact, not evidence that the new source caused it.
  - **A diff of only provenance cells is the OPPOSITE of churn — say so in the write-up.**
    Two rows here changed `witnesses` and `note` with no value moving: the classes now cite
    their real base rather than their own constructor. A skimming reader sees noise; the next
    reader following the citation sees the difference.
- **A hardcoded population count in a TEST is the same defect as one in a report, and worse
  placed.** A harness baseline asserting "15 hubs" went stale the moment a round legitimately
  added a sixteenth — inside a check that *passes*, so nothing announced its expiry. Derive
  it from the population function the code under test already exposes.
- **Two witnesses that are both LOWER BOUNDS on the same relation must be ANDed, never
  required to AGREE.** The instinct on acquiring a second route to a fact is to gate on the
  two agreeing. That is right for witnesses that can err in both directions and **wrong** for
  the common case where each can only MISS evidence, never invent it — there, a
  symmetric-agreement gate fires on the perfectly normal case of one route being quieter than
  the other. Measured: two routes to "does this class have a subclass" — recorded parentage
  (from constructor vptr stores) and destructor-chain descendancy — were gated on agreement
  and the gate raised on two classes. **The data was right and the gate was wrong**: both
  routes depend on a compiler-emitted store that is *deleted where nothing observes it*, and
  the two get deleted in different functions, so each can wrongly say "no subclass" and
  neither can wrongly say "has one".

  Split the one question into two and the asymmetry becomes usable:
  - **SOUNDNESS** — does the new route ever report a relation the established one
    *contradicts*? This is what licenses it to speak at all, and it is graded only on the
    sub-population the established route can speak about. (Here: 309 of 309 gradeable pairs
    confirmed, 0 contradicted; the 35 pairs touching unclassified entities are *counted*, not
    graded, because there is nothing to grade them against.)
  - **PAYLOAD** — does it ADD a relation the established one missed? For a negative claim
    ("no subclass exists") only an addition can overturn it.

  Then take the **AND**: the negative claim holds only where *every* route is silent. And
  **demonstrate each conjunct separately** — remove a known instance from one route and
  require the other to hold the line, then reverse it. Without those two arms there is no
  evidence the second route was load-bearing rather than decorative.
- **When a rule's CALIBRATION cannot exist in the population you are extending it to, SPLIT
  it and say which half is which — do not manufacture a substitute.** A rule has a *claim*
  and a *precondition*, and they can be calibrated in different places. Measured: the claim
  ("for a subclass-free class, the allocation size is exact") could only be calibrated where
  classes have a size known independently of allocation; the target population has no such
  class and structurally never will. The tempting substitute — grading the rule against the
  members already decided — is **circular**, because those were decided by the very witness
  under test. State the split, calibrate the precondition where you can (it was measurable
  there, and more strongly), and **assert the structural zero** so the split retires itself
  the day the population gains an independent witness.
- **When a round breaks an existing test arm, repair the arm's PURPOSE — never delete it or
  relax its expectation.** Measured: a new pin rule overwrote the value an older arm asserted,
  so the arm stopped testing the route it was written for while still passing a weaker check.
  The fix is to run the old arm with the new rule *disabled* (which is why the new rule needs
  a flag anyway, for the two-step diff) and to add a companion arm stating the **precedence**
  between the two rules explicitly — otherwise the ordering of two `if`s is the only record
  of a decision.
- **A rule built for one population must be offered to its SIBLING populations.** Measured:
  a "leaf class allocates exactly its own size" rule decided 57 classes in one population
  and was never extended to a sibling population with an identical evidence shape (same
  allocation witness, same constructor witness), leaving five leaf classes open whose sizes
  its own arithmetic would have decided immediately. This is the "two consumers of one
  rule" hazard pointed at populations instead of code paths, and it is invisible because
  each population's artifact looks internally consistent. When a rule lands, enumerate
  every population carrying the evidence it consumes and record which ones you did not
  extend it to, and why.
  - **The way to offer it is to MOVE it to one copy — not to copy it, and not to re-derive
    it — and to leave its CALIBRATION where it was demonstrated.** Measured on the second
    occurrence of this hazard in the same project: the sibling tool had grown its own
    narrower version of a base-selection rule, which could not walk through an
    intermediate entity carrying no layout, and so *raised* where the shared rule would
    have walked on. Moving the rule to the shared library cost one insert and two renames;
    the five calibration arms stayed in the original tool's selftest, pointed at the moved
    copy, so the rule relocated and its evidence did not have to be rebuilt. A second copy
    would have doubled the calibration debt and guaranteed the two drift.
- **A PRECONDITION THAT RAISES takes the whole round down with it — where a script is
  DECIDING SCOPE, express it as a printed exclusion; keep the raise only where the state
  already exists.** The mutation-safety rules in this document push everything toward
  raising, and that is right for *damage*. It is wrong for *scoping*, and the two look
  identical in code. Measured: a struct applier raised on one entity that had never been
  named and whose parent had no decided layout — so a bare DRY RUN aborted, one un-nameable
  entity blocked the three that were ready, and the abort landed **before** the round's
  before/after payoff measurement, destroying it. Both conditions became exclusions printed
  with a reason and a count. What makes that a repair rather than a loosening is the
  distinction it draws: for an entity that has **already been applied**, the same conditions
  still raise, because its type exists, so a missing namespace or a vanished prefix source is
  damage. Ask of every precondition: *is this the script choosing what to do, or the program
  telling me something broke?*
- **A WALK added beside a single-step rule must inherit the single-step rule's RAISES.**
  Widening "take the base" into "walk the chain" is the common shape of the fix above, and
  the quiet failure is that the walk *stops* where the single step *raised*. Measured: the
  single-step form raised on more than one recorded base (a single-inheritance
  contradiction); the walk was initially written to stop there and return what it had. That
  is a loosening the two-step diff **cannot** see, because the diff compares outcomes on
  data where the contradiction does not occur. Point the existing poison at both functions.
- **A rule change proven INERT everywhere is indistinguishable from one that does nothing —
  so pin what it DID change with a negative twin.** The two-step diff coming back
  byte-identical is what licenses the change, and it is also exactly what a no-op looks
  like. Add an arm requiring the one case the change was made for to succeed under the new
  rule and to fail under the old one, and derive it from the program with a guard, so the
  round that finally fixes that case retires the arm by name instead of leaving it inert.
- **Running a sibling tool purely as an INERTNESS PROOF is also a CENSUS of that tool, and
  that is where the next orphaned mutator is found.** The stability harness
  (`references/assertions.md`) drives read-only sweeps and structurally cannot run appliers, so an applier's queue of work grows
  silently. Measured: a sibling applier was invoked only to show a moved rule had not changed
  its behaviour, and its dry run reported an entity that had become eligible two rounds
  earlier under a rule added one round after that — an approved-census round nobody had
  noticed. Whenever you touch shared machinery, run *every* consumer's dry run and read the
  population line, not just the pass/fail.
- **PRICE A QUEUED ROUND AGAINST THE PROGRAM BEFORE APPLYING IT — a plan's premises decay,
  and the decay is invisible from inside the plan.** A round described as ready in three
  separate notes had four premises refuted by one read-only census script: two call-site
  counts stale by ~200; one "rename" that was really a MERGE into a namespace an earlier
  round had already created from the same evidence; one that needed no rename at all (the
  class was already named — only the *table* lacked a namespace, which turned a blocked
  struct apply into a one-row artifact edit); and two names colliding with types the
  binary's own demangler had built from export signatures. Every one is a fact about the
  program, and none is reachable by re-reading the notes — which is where all three
  descriptions came from. Two follow-ons:
  - **A name collision is EVIDENCE, not an obstacle.** It usually means an earlier round
    reached the same conclusion by another route. Read what is already there before deciding
    what the round does; the operation is often smaller than planned.
  - **But census the colliding name's TIER.** Measured on the same pair: the pre-existing
    names carried the *analyzer* tier and were absent from the agent-name ledger, because
    they predated the tagging discipline — 22 such names across 7 namespaces. Treating "the
    name already exists" as corroboration would have been self-corroboration with years
    between the two halves.
- **WHEN A RESEMBLANCE ARGUMENT IS ACCUMULATING, FIND THE ARTEFACT THE CANDIDATE WOULD HAVE
  LEFT BEHIND AND CHECK WHETHER IT IS THERE.** Attributing a recovered design to a known
  codebase gets easier the more traits you list, and listing traits is not testing. Measured: a
  game's allocator matched a specific published engine on four behaviours including one unique
  to that engine's later version, and the case was becoming persuasive. Two structural tests
  settled it in minutes — *does the bookkeeping live in the struct that engine uses?* (no: four
  loose globals) and *is the magic value that engine writes past each block actually written?*
  (no: across 113 instructions the only constants stored were `0` and one address). The second
  dissolved the strongest coincidence in the case, because the `+4` everyone had read as that
  engine's fingerprint turned out to compensate the allocator's own round-DOWN two lines
  earlier. **A single absent artefact outweighs any number of shared behaviours** — and note
  which way this failed: the resemblance argument was manufacturing a conclusion, not hiding one.
- **Measure a proposed mechanism's REACH before building it.** A cheap probe that counts
  how many targets a route could possibly reach costs minutes and routinely refutes the
  round you were about to spend a day on. Two measured examples from one session: a plan
  to lay out ~229 classes died when a five-line count showed only 56 were reachable at
  all and 12 of the 16 usable ones were already done; and an interprocedural type
  inference died when its own calibration — the cases where the inference could be
  checked against ground truth — disagreed 18 times in 54. Run the counting probe first;
  a refuted round is a cheap round.

  **And measure reach over the whole population, not over the census you already have** —
  an existing census is often a lower bound *by construction*, in a way its summary line
  does not admit. One here enumerated adjacent pairs of recovered tables, so any instance
  whose tail fell below the noise-filter threshold was dropped before the census could see
  it; scoping the round from its 7 findings would have been scoping from a filtered view.
  The whole-population probe happened to confirm exactly 7 and 0 new, which is the outcome
  that makes the check look unnecessary and is precisely why it has to be run.

### Undefined code and the byte-pattern engine

- **A BYTE PATTERN'S FALSE-POSITIVE RATE IS DIRECTLY COUNTABLE AGAINST THE FUNCTIONS YOU
  ALREADY HAVE — count it before mining anything.** Mining function-start patterns from a
  program's own corpus (`Ghidra/Features/BytePatterns`,
  `ClosedPatternRowObject.mineClosedPatterns`) is the obvious way to attack undefined code, and
  the obvious way to price it — how many candidates would it produce — is the wrong axis.
  **A wrong function start ABSORBS the true function after it**, so the mechanism damages the
  population it is meant to grow, and the function count rises either way. Precision decides the
  round, and your existing functions *are* the graded set: every occurrence of a candidate
  prologue inside a defined body but **not at its entry** is a place the pattern would fire
  wrongly. Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary with 5,629 known starts: `c3909090`
  (`RET; NOP NOP NOP`) is **54 starts against 3,230 interiors — 1.6% precision**; `c2040090`
  is 29 against 972; only **5 of the top 25** reach 95%. And the vocabulary itself refused the
  round before precision even mattered: **1,950 distinct 4-byte prologues over 5,629 starts,
  top 25 covering 34.1%**. Derive the count two independent ways (per-entry reads, and a bulk
  image scan classified against the same start set) and **raise if they disagree** — that is the
  only thing that catches a misaligned bulk read, which would silently invalidate every number.
- **PRICE THE UNDEFINED-CODE SEARCH SPACE BY CONTENT, NOT BY RANGE COUNT — the filler
  dominates, and the headline number is a span.** `Listing.getUndefinedRanges` over
  `Memory.getExecuteSet()` is the right enumeration and its total is not the population.
  Measured: "5,321 ranges / 87,713 bytes", carried across several rounds, resolved into
  **5,033 ranges / 44,440 bytes of pure `0xCC`/`0x00`/`0x90` alignment padding**, 52 ranges under
  8 bytes, and a candidate-bearing residue of **236 ranges / 43,139 bytes**. 95% of the ranges
  could never hold a function. Classify each range by content before scoping anything on it.
- **`PseudoDisassembler.isValidSubroutine` IS NOT A DISCRIMINATOR — 100% RECALL, 72%
  FALSE-ACCEPT — AND ONLY THE NEGATIVE TWIN SAYS SO.** `ghidra.app.util.PseudoDisassembler` is
  genuinely read-only (its own javadoc: creates no references or symbols, needs no transaction),
  which makes it the right instrument to reach for and the easy one to over-trust. Graded both
  ways on one binary: **400 of 400** sampled known function starts accepted
  (`isValidSubroutine(addr, allowExistingCode=True)`), and **288 of 400** sampled known function
  *interiors* accepted too. So "N undisassembled ranges decode cleanly" is close to
  information-free — a recall-only calibration would have published 224 such ranges as a finding.
  This is the skill's "calibrate by positive agreement, not only absence of contradiction" rule
  pointed at its mirror image: here the recall arm passes trivially and the *precision* arm is
  the one that refuses the instrument.
- **A GAP BOUNDED BY TWO DEFINED FUNCTIONS IS A SAFER PLACE TO CREATE A FUNCTION THAN OPEN
  BYTES — measure the bounding before accepting a stated hazard.** "A false positive absorbs the
  true following function" is the correct objection to pattern-driven function creation in open
  bytes, and it is **void** where the following function already exists in the database.
  Measured: of 236 candidate ranges, **221 were preceded by a defined function ending in a flow
  terminator and 210 were followed immediately by a defined function START** — whole functions
  sitting in bounded gaps of an otherwise contiguous `.text`. The bounding is a safety property
  no byte pattern supplies, and it is one cheap census away.
- **ASK WHETHER AN UNDISASSEMBLED BOUNDARY TRUNCATES A DEFINED FUNCTION — it is cheap and it
  grades your whole evidence base at once.** If a defined body stops at such a boundary while its
  last instruction still **falls through**, that function is cut short in the database, and every
  witness computed by walking function bodies — write sets, construction extents, read/write
  cells, and every layout resting on them — has been reading a partial body and reporting a
  complete answer. Nothing warns. Ask each instruction's own `FlowType` (`isTerminal()`,
  `isJump()`, `hasFallthrough()`), never a mnemonic list, and **calibrate both ways over the
  whole corpus first** — measured, 5,628 of 5,629 defined functions end in a flow terminator and
  1 falls through, which is what makes the answer (**0 of 236 truncated**) a measurement rather
  than a property of the probe. On this binary it was the most valuable thing the round produced,
  and it was a reassurance, not a defect.
- **SEPARATE FEASIBILITY FROM VALUE, AND MEASURE BOTH.** The same population was recoverable
  *and* worthless: **11 references reach all 43,139 residue bytes, every one `DATA`, none a
  `CALL`** — linker-retained code the game never runs, appearing in no tick. A round can be
  perfectly feasible and still not worth running; a pricing probe that reports only reach has
  answered half the question. Say which half you measured.

- **TO ASK WHAT A SHIPPED ANALYZER WOULD DO, BORROW ITS MACHINERY — DO NOT REIMPLEMENT ITS
  RULES.** This is the "check for a built-in before writing your own" rule applied to a *question*
  rather than to a task, and it is the higher-value form. Measured: the question "can Ghidra's
  shipped function-start patterns fire anywhere in these undisassembled bytes" would have required
  hand-rolling ditted-bit matching, pre/post pattern pairing, a fixed-bit budget and four
  post-match prerequisites — four chances to be subtly wrong, each failing in the direction that
  MANUFACTURES a finding. What it actually takes:
  - `ghidra.app.analyzers.Patterns.getPatternDecisionTree()` → `findPatternFiles(program, tree)`
    — **ask which pattern files apply to this program** rather than assuming; it resolves through
    `patternconstraints.xml` and a `ProgramDecisionTree`.
  - `ghidra.util.bytesearch.Pattern.readPatterns(resourceFile, arrayList, patternFactory)` —
    parses them, and `PatternPairSet.createFinalPatterns` applies the bit budget internally.
  - `MemoryBytePatternSearcher(name, patternList)` + `setSearchExecutableOnly(true)` +
    `searchAll(program, monitor)` — the same `BulkPatternSearcher` the analyzer runs.

  **The seam that keeps it read-only is the `MatchAction`, not the search.** The production
  `PatternFactory` is `FunctionStartAnalyzer` *itself*, and instantiating it is NOT read-only —
  its `applyActionToSet` calls `func.setNoReturn(true)` and writes an `AddressSetPropertyMap`.
  Supply your own `PatternFactory` (a plain interface: `getMatchActionByName`,
  `getPostRuleByName`, so `@JImplements` works from PyGhidra) returning `MatchAction`s whose
  `apply` records and whose `restoreXml` keeps the XML attributes — those attributes carry the
  analyzer's extra prerequisites and decide whether a match is unconditional. `DummyMatchAction`
  is the shipped no-op template.
- **A PATTERN FILE IS A CROSS PRODUCT FILTERED BY AN INFORMATION BUDGET, NOT A LIST OF BYTE
  STRINGS.** `PatternPairSet.createFinalPatterns` builds a final pattern from a (prepattern,
  postpattern) pair only if `postcheck >= postBitsOfCheck` **and**
  `precheck + postcheck >= totalBitsOfCheck`, both counting FIXED (non-ditted) bits. Measured, and
  it demolished an apparently perfect counter-example: thirteen NOPs followed by `SUB ESP,0x10`
  matches the shipped `0x90` prepattern against the shipped `0x83ec 0.....00` postpattern — and
  `0x90` supplies 8 fixed bits while that postpattern supplies 19, so at `totalbits="32"` **the
  pair is never built.** Reading the prologue bytes can never reveal this; reading
  `createFinalPatterns` reveals it in one line.
- **A SHIPPED PATTERN CAN BE STRUCTURALLY INCAPABLE OF FIRING WHERE YOU ARE LOOKING, AND ITS HIT
  COUNT STILL READS AS A FINDING.** Post-match attributes are prerequisites, checked in
  `FunctionStartAnalyzer.checkPreRequisites` long after the bytes match: `validcode="function"`
  requires an **existing** function at the address; `after="func|inst|data|ptr|def"` runs
  `checkAfterName`; `validcode="N"` runs `PseudoDisassembler.checkValidSubroutine`. Measured: 628
  of 640 matches inside undisassembled bytes were the `<data>0xcc</data>` `__break` pattern, which
  carries `validcode="function"` — impossible in undefined bytes by definition — and all 628 were
  INT3 filler. Counted naively that is a 640-strong false positive on a census of padding. **Read
  each pattern's attributes before counting its hits**, and note where a refusal is *structural*
  rather than incidental: `checkAfterName`'s fallback `pureDataReferencesOnly` opens with
  `if (!referencesTo.hasNext()) return false;`, so **no references is a refusal, not a pass**.
- **CALIBRATE A BORROWED ENGINE THE SAME WAY YOU CALIBRATE A WITNESS.** A "0 matches in the region
  I care about" result is worth nothing until the engine has been shown to fire where it should.
  The arm: run it over the whole program and require a large share of its matches to land on
  function starts that already exist (measured: 1,205 of 2,905, **41.5%**). Raise if the file
  resolution returns nothing, if 0 final patterns are built, if the search returns 0 matches, or
  if 0 land on a known start — each of those turns the headline zero into a fact about your
  wiring rather than about the program.
### Identity, joins and populations

- **Do not classify a population member by what it is NOT.** "Not a table start, therefore
  interior to a table" is only sound if the tables tile the region — and recovered runs
  almost never tile anything (262 gaps totalling ~37KB here). The wrong label is invisible
  because it is usually right. Compute the actual extents and emit the third bucket
  (`start` / `interior` / `gap`); the gap cases are where the surprises live, since an
  address in a gap may sit inside something the noise filter discarded entirely.
- **A short name is not an identity — join on ADDRESSES, not names.** Demangled short names
  collide across a hierarchy: an override shares its base's name, so two different tables can
  look identical.
  - **And a NAMING ROUND is what proves whether you actually did.** Measured: applying four
    long-established class identities broke **five** separate checks at once, each of which
    had memorised a spelling where it meant an entity — an approved-scope constant recording
    which node a previous round was authorised to add (by its old label), a
    `startswith("UNKNOWN_")` standing in for "is this an unnamed class" (a *tier* question),
    two tests, one of them a **poison that silently went inert**, and two diagnostics. All
    five were repaired by resolving the table ADDRESS through a helper that had already been
    made rename-proof once, for a different class — the fix existed and had simply never
    travelled to the sites that needed it. If your project has never renamed anything, treat
    every name-keyed join as unproven rather than as working.
  - **The dangerous one is a label a producer emits for an entity it CREATES.** A sweep that
    folds in a new node looked its label up in a map built *before* the fold, so the one node
    it adds always fell through to the synthetic `UNKNOWN_0x…` spelling. Harmless while that
    node had no other name; the moment the class was decided, that artifact disagreed with
    every other artifact, a downstream rule joined the two **by name**, and a class silently
    regressed from an exact size to an open interval. Nothing errored.
- **ADJUDICATE A RELABEL BY ASKING WHETHER THE ARTIFACT IS THE OLD ONE WITH THE NAMES
  SUBSTITUTED — a positional diff cannot answer that.** Renaming changes SORT ORDER, so a
  row-by-row comparison reports nearly every row of a re-sorted file as changed and the real
  change hides in the noise. Normalise both sides, substitute the renamed labels, sort, and
  compare as MULTISETS. Measured: 10 of 14 changed artifacts were provably pure relabels,
  two more differed only in the ordering of names inside list-valued cells, and exactly two
  carried the regression worth finding — which had been one line among fourteen.
- **Population counts depend on the symbol filter, silently.** In this project
  `getExternalFunctions()` returned 134 imports, not the expected 136, because two of them
  exist only as `SymbolType.Label` and not as `Function` symbols — so that API cannot see
  them at all. Verify a population before building on its size.
- **A hand-written seed list can contain structurally inert entries.** Of 28 marker
  imports seeded into a call-graph closure, 2 were unreachable by the mechanism consuming
  them, so the effective seed set was 26. Check that each seed is actually visible to the
  API that will consume it, and report the effective count, not the written one.
- **`Function.getName()` is unqualified; `getName(True)` includes the namespace.**
  Comparing the wrong one against a namespace-qualified expectation makes a check
  *structurally unable to match* — it reports 0/N forever and reads as a failing sweep
  rather than a broken test. This exact bug produced four dead checks in this project.
  Likewise raw mangled names and demangled short names are different string spaces that
  never intersect; converting one to the other is required before comparison.

### Samples, headers and new witness kinds

- **A PINNED SAMPLE MEASURES THE ROUND THAT CHOSE IT, FOREVER — AND IT FAILS QUIETLY, BY
  UNDERSTATING.** Measured: an applier scored its own payoff over five literal function addresses
  picked several rounds earlier for a different class. The round that finally mattered applied 13
  fields witnessed in **ten other bodies, none of them in the sample**, so the applier reported
  "no change" and concluded it had bought nothing. The number was true and the claim was false:
  it was a statement about the sample. **When a measurement over a fixed sample returns zero,
  verify the sample intersects the change before reporting the zero** — and prefer a sample
  DERIVED from the same artifact the round is applying, so it grows with the evidence. Here that
  was 5 → 38 bodies and a real payoff of 110 lines. Same shape as a literal row index beside an
  editable header, or a pinned census beside a growing population: **a literal sitting next to
  something that evolves.** Sweep for the shape rather than fixing the instance — in that repo,
  four such lists existed and exactly one was the defect; naming the other three (one already
  derived, two pinned on purpose) is what turns a worry into a closed answer.
- **THE SCRIPT'S OWN WARNING IS THE FINDING, AND IT IS ONE LINE FROM BEING IGNORED.** That
  applier printed *"the payoff did NOT increase ... check the sample reaches bodies these types
  are ON."* Everything needed was on screen; the available failure was to read the clean
  invariants and move on. **An honesty check earns nothing unless the round budgets the
  follow-up** — a printed caveat nobody acts on is worse than absent, because it documents that
  you were told.
- **`csv.DictReader` SILENTLY COLLAPSES A DUPLICATE FIELDNAME AND SHIFTS EVERY COLUMN AFTER IT.**
  Measured: a header carried **10 names over 9 values** (one name twice), so a late column had
  been quietly returning a different field's data — in that case the program version — for
  however long the defect had existed. No exception, no warning, and the values are all
  plausible strings. **Guard the header explicitly**: assert the names are unique and that their
  count equals the first data row's field count. Both are one line, and nothing else in the
  stack will tell you.
- **BEFORE ADDING A WITNESS KIND, NAME THE POPULATION IT ALONE REACHES.** Measured: a producer's
  four existing kinds were all constructor initialisations and serialiser records, so **a field
  written elsewhere and never saved was invisible to every one of them** — and the artifact
  said "no witness reaches these bytes" over a region the game writes seven dwords into every
  tick. The note was true of the kinds it had and false about the program. A fifth kind is worth
  its cost exactly when that sentence can be written for it; if it only agrees with what the
  others already see, it is a confidence upgrade, not a new witness. And **a new kind arrives
  with its exclusion rules already paid for by earlier rounds — do not re-derive them at
  intake**, because a consumer that re-derives an upstream adjudication is a second copy of one
  rule, and the two drift.

### Register conventions you "know" are per-function facts

- **`EBP` IS NOT A FRAME POINTER JUST BECAUSE IT USUALLY IS.** With frame-pointer omission (MSVC
  `/Oy`, on by default at `/O2`) `EBP` is an ordinary general register, and compilers use it to
  hold whatever is hot — including an object pointer. Measured: a probe classifying `rep movsd`
  destinations hardcoded `("ESP", "EBP")` as frame registers, and so read
  `LEA EDI,[EBP + 0x7c]` — the copy that establishes a 268-byte embedded record at
  `<object> + 0x7c`, the single fact the whole analysis line was built on — as *"a write to a
  stack local at offset 124."* **And 124 is 0x7c in decimal**, so the wrong answer looked
  plausible. Decide the frame register **per function**, from the prologue (`PUSH EBP;
  MOV EBP,ESP`), not per program. The same caution applies to any "this register means X"
  assumption: `ESI`/`EDI` as string pointers, `ECX` as `this`, `EBX` as a preserved base — all are
  conventions the optimizer is free to ignore between calls.
- **A SMALL DELTA IN A CENSUS IS NOT EVIDENCE THAT THE DEFECT WAS SMALL.** Fixing the above moved
  **3 of 176** destination classifications — under 2% — and one of the three was the fact the
  entire arc rested on. **Grade a correction by WHICH rows moved, not how many.** The instinct to
  shrug at a 2% change is exactly wrong when the population is heterogeneous in importance.
- **CALIBRATE ON THE PROPERTY THE PROBE EXISTS TO MEASURE, NOT A CORRELATE OF IT.** That probe
  carried a deliberate calibration: re-derive the hand reading that motivated it. It asked for *a
  copy of the right SIZE in the right function* and found seven — and never asked where any of
  them wrote to, which was the entire output of the round that added destination resolution. It
  therefore **passed for two rounds while the one row it was calibrating against was
  misclassified.** A calibration that cannot fail when the headline is wrong is decoration. Pin
  the output, not an input that correlates with it.
- **QUERY YOUR OWN ARTIFACT FOR A FACT YOU ALREADY KNOW BEFORE TRUSTING IT FOR ONE YOU DO NOT.**
  The defect surfaced only because a later task needed the artifact to answer a different
  question, and the row that should obviously have been there was absent. That is a one-line check
  against a known answer, and it caught a two-round defect that every internal consistency check
  had passed.

### An artifact carrying program-state columns must be regenerated AFTER its own round's apply — and if a column flips, fix the COLUMN

**Measured.** A round produced a new artifact, then applied types to the program, then ran the
stability harness — which reported the artifact `CHANGED`. It had: the sweep recorded per-class
program state (`does a type exist`, `which route applies`) and the round's own apply had changed
exactly that.

The tempting fixes are both wrong. Excusing the artifact from the harness removes the only thing
that would notice it going stale later; annotating "expect churn here" is the same thing written
politely. The two fixes that were right:

- **Make the column mean something stable.** `struct_route` was rewritten to name the route a class
  *belongs to*, not whether the work has been done yet — so it reads the same before and after the
  apply. A column that answers "what kind of thing is this" is stable; one that answers "is it
  finished" is a progress indicator and does not belong beside evidence.
- **Make the sweep and the applier share ONE state machine.** They had independent copies of the
  same rule and disagreed about what `applied` meant. Two producers with private copies of one rule
  is the divergence hazard, inside a single repo — and here the applier re-derives the rule and
  **raises if it disagrees with the artifact's own column**, so the two cannot drift apart quietly.

Residual, and worth stating rather than hiding: some columns are irreducibly program-state
(`type_state` here). Those change once, at the apply, and are stable thereafter — so **regenerate
and commit the post-apply version**, and expect exactly one churned generation per mutating round.

### One bracket's raise costs a reach fault too — expect two faults with one cause

**Measured twice, in different rounds.** A probe pins an absolute whole-program invariant (the
datatype count). A round legitimately changes it; the probe raises — the bracket working. But **a
producer that raises does not regenerate its artifact**, so that artifact is then counted
`unchanged` with nothing having re-derived it, and the reach adjudicator reports it as a second,
apparently unrelated fault.

A round that changes the pinned quantity should expect **two complaints and one cause**, and must
not go hunting for a second one. Write the pairing down beside the bracket, because the second
fault names a completely different file and reads like an independent problem.

And when re-pinning: **account for the delta BY NAME, never by subtraction.** Keep a per-round list
of the names the apply is expected to have added and assert the list is present (here 15 of 15),
and have the *applier itself* assert the added name-set across its own mutation — so the count and
the account cannot drift apart on a replay the way a bare number lets them.

### A change log is not a census — and two nearly-right accounts are worse than none

**Measured.** A whole-program datatype bracket moved **+136** on a round that applied *no types at
all* (naming functions into new class namespaces materialises a placeholder type per namespace).
The standing rule is that re-pinning such a bracket requires accounting for the delta **by name**,
so two reconstructions were tried: counting placeholder types among the affected classes gave
**140**; asking the project's own applied-types ledger which of those already existed gave **138**.

Both were close enough to write up. Neither was right, and the reason generalises: **that ledger
records what YOUR rounds created. It is a change log, not a census** — it cannot see a type that
arrived with the importer, the demangler, or an analyzer. Deriving "what existed before" from a
record of "what I did" is only valid if you are the only writer, and on a Ghidra project you never
are.

**A 2-to-4 row residual is exactly the size of a real defect and exactly small enough to round
off.** So measure instead of reconstructing: restore the pre-round snapshot into a scratch project
file, enumerate the full name census on both sides, and diff. Result here: 136 added, 0 removed,
all placeholders — and the probe **asserts** that `added - removed` reconciles with the count
rather than leaving a reader to eyeball it.

Two riders:

- **Census everything the invariant counts, not just the interesting kind.** A datatype count
  counts pointers, arrays and function definitions too. A struct-only census would have reported a
  residual it structurally could not explain, and the natural next move — widening the tolerance —
  would have destroyed the check.
- **Snapshot-diffing is cheap and nobody does it.** The snapshot already exists because the
  checkpoint discipline created it. Restoring it read-only into a scratch file, diffing, and
  deleting the scratch is a few dozen lines, and it answers "what actually changed" for any
  program-wide quantity — permanently, instead of per-round detective work.

### A measured zero needs its mechanism, or it is a bug you have not found yet

**Measured, twice in one round.** "No ancestor's exported symbols name any of these vtable slots:
**0 of 179**" was produced, doubted on sight, and re-run — the first version had walked only the
*immediate* base, which was a genuine defect in the reader. The zero survived the fix, and only
then was it worth anything, because it acquired an explanation: the relevant ancestor's
mangled-named slots stop at index 151, while every override in question sits at slot 38 or in the
152–176 range that is the class's own extension.

A zero with a mechanism is a finding you can build on. A zero without one is indistinguishable from
a scanner that looked in the wrong place — and it reads as *"nothing to find here"* to every later
round. **Before recording any zero, state the mechanism that produces it and check that the
mechanism predicts the non-zeros too.**

### A wrong join key produces a MISSING answer, not a wrong one — re-key before believing an absence

The sibling of the rule above, and the more dangerous half. A mislabelled row invites a challenge:
somebody reads `CHoverTruck` where they expected `CVehicle` and asks why. **An absence invites
nothing.** Nobody audits a blank.

**Measured.** A harvester attributed each function to a class through a *derived* label column that a
long-standing project rule had already deprecated as unreliable. The consequence was not a wrong
class — it was that a corroborating witness was found for **0 of 30** functions. Re-keyed on the
address instead of the label, the same join found it for **24 of 30**, every one independently
verified against memory. The defect had survived in a committed producer precisely because its
output was an emptiness, and an emptiness looks like the world rather than like a bug.

Worse, an intermediate finding built on the bad join — a tidy, quotable claim about a standing
backlog item — was entirely an artefact of it, and was caught only because the next step happened to
re-key the same join. **The satisfying lead derived from a suspect instrument is the one to
re-derive first**, because its appeal is exactly what stops you checking it.

Three cheap habits, in order of payoff:

- **Join on identity, not on a label.** An address, an ordinal, a file offset — something the
  program defines. A name or a derived class label is a *display* of identity and can be produced by
  a heuristic somebody deprecated years ago.
- **When a join returns nothing, re-run it with a second key before writing the zero down.** One
  line, and it separates "the evidence is absent" from "my key was wrong".
- **Normalise before joining, and check spelling divergence between artifacts.** Two files in the
  same repo spelled the same table `UNKNOWN_004dda7c` and `UNKNOWN_0x004dda7c`; a naive join reports
  every row as missing, which reads as a finding about the program.

## Delegating a batch to a reader who does not trust your probe is a test of the probe

The largest source of independent scrutiny a producer will ever get is not a review of its code. It
is **handing its output to someone who has to act on it and does not already know what each column
means.**

Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 project: six evidence packs, built by one census script, went to six
independent readers with instructions to name the functions in them. Four defects came back and
**all four were in the instruments, not in the readings.**

- **A `vptr_store` column fired on every `MOV [reg], imm32`** — including a body assigning a *string
  pointer* to a field. The program's message pump was reported as installing a vtable, because it
  does `pCrashTracer = "PeekWindows"`. **Three of the six readers refused that citation
  independently**, one observing that a message pump cannot be a constructor. The fix is a property
  of the *target*, not of the store: a vftable's first slot holds a pointer into `.text`; a string's
  first four bytes do not. The column fell 217 → 187, i.e. **14% of it was noise** that had been in
  a committed producer, unremarked, for as long as the column existed.
- **An external callee's address was emitted as if it were citable.** Ghidra puts external functions
  in their own address space, where `getOffset()` returns a small ordinal — so a callee census
  reported `RegCloseKey` as the address `0x00000015`. A reader cited it faithfully; the defect was
  never theirs. **Filter on `isMemoryAddress()` (or `isExternal()`) before emitting any address a
  consumer might use as a key.**

The general shape: **a probe's output is normally read only by its author, who knows what each
column means and unconsciously discounts the cells that look wrong.** A reader who has no such
prior is the cheapest external check the producer will ever get, and the cost is one file.

### The join that is correct only until somebody does the project's work

A calibration arm compared `function.getName()` — unfiltered — against the name its own scanner had
recorded through the **agent-source filter**. Those two agree only while the function is unnamed.
The moment the project named it, they disagreed, and the arm raised claiming the scanner had lost
all five of its hand-verified answers. It had lost none.

The lesson was **already written forty lines further down the same file**, where a different arm in
the same probe says *"MEMBERSHIP BY ADDRESS, never by name — a short name is not an identity"*. That
arm had learned it the hard way. The first one was left keyed on a name because, at the time, the
name was a `FUN_`-style placeholder and therefore *accidentally unique*.

> **A key that is unique only because nothing has been named yet is a time bomb primed by success.**
> When a probe teaches you a lesson, grep the file it lives in before grepping the repo — the same
> author made the same assumption twice within one screen more often than not.

### Apply the anti-circularity guard to the SEARCH, not only to the comparison

A new witness kind guarded every instruction test with a helper that read **both** Ghidra references
and raw operand scalars — precisely because Ghidra does not create a reference for a
`MOV [imm32], reg`. It then *discovered* the candidate bodies to test by calling
`getReferencesTo(...)`, which has exactly that blind spot, and duly reported *"the initializer shape
is gone"* for a five-instruction body sitting in plain sight.

Then, once the search was rebuilt as a program-wide index, it matched only the operand spelling
`dword ptr [0x…]` — while an **absolute** store renders as bare `[0x…]`, which is the form the
target used.

> **Two levels, two chances to be blind.** A correct comparison fed by an incomplete candidate set
> produces a confident zero. Whenever a check filters, ask what *enumerated* the things it filters.

### An argument can name a function that nothing inside it can

A function with **82 call sites**, no import call, no string literal of its own and four anonymous
globals was looked at by three separate rounds and declined each time — there was nothing inside it
to read.

What named it was **what its callers pass in**. At 34 of the 82 sites the caller loads a global that
some initializer filled with `GetId("<some name>")`, and every one of the 26 distinct globals so
reached traced to a developer-written label. The chain — *a caller loads G within the argument
window of the call; some body stores to G and references the string at S; the bytes at S read as a
string* — is three program facts and consults no symbol, so it is checkable forever and cannot be
satisfied by your own markup.

Generalise it: **when a body carries no evidence, look one frame up.** Argument setup is program
fact, and in code that resolves resources by name at start-up it is routinely more self-documenting
than the callee. The same shape appears wherever a program interns strings to ids: resource
managers, event systems, script bindings, message dispatch.

## A pruning sweep is a reachability sweep, and reachability finds load-bearing things nobody can find

Run periodically: **which scripts and artifacts is nothing pointing at?** The framing is "delete the
redundant", and on a healthy project the answer will mostly not be deletions.

Measured on one long-running project — 374 scripts, **6 referenced nowhere outside themselves, and
none of the six was redundant**:

- One **created three functions that a whole-program invariant depends on.** The project's function
  count is checked as `baseline + <enumerated creations>` by every gate it has, and this script
  contributed one of the terms — while appearing in **no** run-order document, gate list or log. It
  read as a dead one-off. It was a step nobody could have replayed.
- One was **the tool to run first after a bad apply** (does the undo stack still reach the last
  checked-in version, or is a snapshot the only route left?) — precisely the thing you cannot afford
  to go looking for during the emergency.
- The remaining four were genuine one-offs of a few kilobytes each, and each was **the evidence
  trail for a recorded finding**. Deleting them saves nothing and costs provenance.

> **A gate checks what it is pointed at.** Nothing in a verification harness can notice a component
> that no list contains — that is the one defect class gates are structurally blind to, and a
> reachability sweep is the only cheap instrument that sees it.

Practical form, and it is a dozen lines: enumerate every script and artifact, concatenate every
document/script/config as a corpus, and report the ones whose name never appears outside their own
file. Then **read each result before deciding anything** — the interesting ones are load-bearing.

### Excusing an artifact repeatedly is a deferral, not a decision

Verification harnesses grow exclusion lists — "this artifact has no producer, skip it". Once an
entry's reason is effectively *nobody maintains this*, the artifact should be **retired, not
excused**. One had been carried under `(none — orphaned)` with an entry saying in as many words that
it was excluded *"because it has no producer, not because it is trusted"*; its row count was one per
pre-merge item against a set that had since been merged.

**An excused artifact is still a FILE**, in the directory everything joins against, and **a stale
artifact that nothing regenerates is worse than an absent one, because it ANSWERS** — plausible rows,
no warning. The exclusion list protects the harness; it does not protect the next author, who will
find the file and use it.

Delete the exclusion entry together with the artifact, and make sure the harness has an arm that
catches an exclusion outliving its file — otherwise the list accumulates ghosts.

### Grade deletion targets by RECOVERABILITY before size

Three targets in one round, three risk classes, and only one needed real ceremony:

| target | recoverable? | what it needs |
|---|---|---|
| a version-controlled artifact | yes, from history | a write-up, no more |
| a scratch directory | *usually* — check, don't assume | verify the claim first (below) |
| ~1 GB of version-control-ignored snapshots | **no** | a stated retention RULE, not a per-file judgement |

For the irreversible one, a rule beats judgement: **keep everything a document names by name, plus a
fixed newest-N window, plus the test fixtures** — mechanical, auditable, and it survives the reviewer
disagreeing with you about any individual file. And check first whether the *primary* recovery path
is something else entirely; here the tool's own version control held every version and the snapshots
were the belt to its braces, which is what made the deletion sane at all.

### "Fully regenerable" is a claim to check, not an adjective to apply

A scratch directory was approved for deletion on that basis and it was **not true**. The mechanical
outputs regenerated from one command. The *delegated readings* did not: their rationale column held
**why a reader believed a conclusion**, and the permanent records kept the conclusion and its
supporting facts but not the reasoning. A judgment cannot be recomputed — which is exactly why its
output has to be **stored** rather than regenerated.

> Before deleting anything called scratch, ask which of its files were produced by a **decision**
> rather than by a script. Those are not scratch, whatever directory they are sitting in.

Keep such records in their **pre-adjudication** form. A quarter of that batch's rows were rejected,
and what a reader got *wrong* is the evidence that priced the filter — the survivors alone cannot
tell you how good the process was.

## A producer written this hour is not safer than one written last year — it is less tested

The instinct is to trust fresh code and audit old code. Invert it. An old producer has survived
every consumer that ever read it; a new one has survived none, and its selftest was written by the
same person, in the same hour, from the same wrong mental model.

Measured: a round built a class-level evidence-pack generator, ran its selftest (10/10, after one
genuine failure it fixed), generated five packs and dispatched five delegated readers. The generator
carried a defect that would have produced **7 confidently wrong names out of 61**. Two independent
readers caught it within the hour. Nothing else was watching, precisely *because* it was new — the
round's attention was on the readers' judgment, not on the instrument that fed them.

- **Treat a new producer's FIRST output as a hypothesis the first consumer is testing**, and say so
  in the brief. Both readers who caught the defect had been told explicitly that defects in our own
  probes were a valuable finding; both delivered one.
- **A passing selftest on a new producer means the author's model is self-consistent**, not that it
  matches the binary. The failing check is worth more than the passing suite: write checks that pin
  a MEASURED value rather than a bound, so that being wrong about the value fires immediately. One
  such check here was written as `< 20`, fired on first run against real data, and the correct
  answer turned out to be 18 — the threshold was wrong, not the artifact.

## No silent caps — a truncated list reads as a measured absence

A harvester that emits `"|".join(items[:8])` is not making a display choice. A consumer that reads
eight strings and a body that references ten cannot tell the difference between *"this body has
eight strings"* and *"someone stopped counting at eight"* — and the first reading is the one every
consumer will make, because a full-looking list is indistinguishable from a complete one.

Measured: a census capped nine separate list columns (`[:8]`, `[:4]`, `[:12]`) with no ellipsis and
no count. A delegated reader working a body that builds a **six**-wide resolution array saw the cell
stop at the fourth entry, and called it *"the finding that would have most changed my reading."*
The reader recovered the rest by hand from the disassembly; one who had not noticed would have
reported a four-resolution screen with full confidence and a clean citation.

- **Emit the horizon: `+N more`.** The cap itself is usually fine and worth keeping — it is the
  silence that is the defect.
- **Sweep the file when you find one.** Caps cluster: they are written in one sitting, in one
  `rows.append([...])`, and fixing one of nine leaves eight producing confident wrong numbers.
- **The same rule applies to an empty block.** When a per-item report has nothing to say about an
  item because the item was never gathered, say *that*, loudly. The same round found evidence packs
  printing a blank citation menu for bodies that already carried a name — because the census
  covering them was scoped to unnamed bodies — and the blank read as *"references nothing."*

### And the cap comes back as a blind spot in the CHECK you write next

Adding `+N more` fixes the *consumer's* reading. It does not fix the next thing anyone writes: a
guard over the emitted artifact. That guard reads the capped cell, so **it judges a sample and
reports a clean zero for anything past the horizon** — the same measured-absence defect the cap
rule exists to prevent, rebuilt one function lower down and now wearing the authority of an
assertion.

Measured, in the same file whose `cap` docstring records the incident above. A new guard asserted
that no emitted citation names a placeholder. Run over the CSV it found **1**; run over the
uncapped in-memory lists the same run found **4**. On a quieter day the emitted-cell version would
have returned zero and been believed.

- **A guard belongs on the widest form of the data the producer holds**, not on the form it prints.
  Accumulate the complete list and assert over that.
- **Keep the emitted-cell arm too**, as the weaker second one: it is the only thing that catches a
  defect introduced at the *formatting* stage, which the uncapped list cannot see.
- **Any count taken from a capped artifact is a FLOOR.** Say so where the number is quoted — one
  round's "146 citations" was measured from the emitted file and inherited by the next round's
  write-up as if it were a census.

## When you fix a join in one checker, grep the file for the same join

The cheapest possible instance of *sweep the pattern, not the instance*, and it was still missed.

A citation checker resolved a class NAME through a hierarchy artifact, which made an entire family
uncitable because none of its 45 tables appears in that artifact. The fix — accept a raw table
ADDRESS as an alternative — was applied to that one checker, with a comment explaining the
reasoning. **Four lines below, in the same file, a second checker did the identical lookup and was
left alone for two rounds.** Measured when a later round tried to use it: **0 of 45** tables
resolvable, and the failure message read *"no vtable for class X"* — which sounds like a fact about
the class rather than a defect in the join.

**Grep for the HELPER, not for the symptom.** `vt_of.get(norm_table(...))` had exactly two call
sites and one of them was fixed. A one-line grep at fix time would have closed both.

## The fresh measurement is not automatically the right one

When a number you just computed disagrees with a committed one, the instinct is to trust yours: it
is visible, it is recent, and its code is in front of you. That instinct is backwards. The committed
producer has survived every consumer that ever read it and carries calibrations you have not
reproduced; your ad-hoc join has neither.

**Measured.** A project had 547 recorded as the size of a residue. An ad-hoc join written to re-check
it said **979** — wrong by 432 in the alarming direction, and enough to have scoped the next round
against a problem 76% larger than the real one. The committed producer attributed each offset to
whichever class **in the inheritance chain** owned it; the ad-hoc join compared against the class's
own fields only, so every inherited field counted as unexplained. The explanation was already in a
comment beside the chain walk.

- **Before believing the disagreement, read what the committed producer DOES THAT YOURS DOES NOT** —
  the specific operation, not "which looks right".
- **An ad-hoc join is a HYPOTHESIS about the committed one, never a check on it.** Use it to locate a
  disagreement; resolve the disagreement by reading, never by preferring the newer number.
- This is the mirror of *a producer written this hour is less tested*: the same asymmetry, pointed at
  a number instead of at a tool.

## Decompose a residue before pricing it

A residue quoted as a single number is not yet a price, and the number is usually inflated by
structure rather than by content.

**Measured**, on the 547 above:

1. **Duplication by design.** Save and Load each contributed a row for the same field, so 547 ROWS
   were **283 distinct `(class, offset)` pairs**. That duplication was the witness's built-in
   cross-check, not noise — halving the number and gaining a check.
2. **Inheritance replication.** Grouping by immediate base, **32 base-class fields explained 445 of
   the 547 (81%)**: one field on a base with 26 subclasses appears 52 times.

Real backlog: **83 decisions with a 32-item head**, against a headline of 547. Always ask of a
residue: *how many DISTINCT facts is this, and how many of them are one fact seen from N places?*

**Group by IMMEDIATE parent, not by root, when one root dominates.** Root grouping put all 283 pairs
in a single bucket because 223 of 224 tables descended from one class. A key whose distribution you
have not checked is not a key — see *check the distribution of whatever you key on before trusting
the key*.

## A built-in cross-check must be MEASURED, not admired

Some witnesses carry their own consistency check: two independently compiled bodies that must agree
(a serializer and its deserializer, a constructor and its destructor, a writer and its reader). That
property is worth a lot and is usually written proudly into the producer's header.

**Measured: it had been described in the header since the day the probe was written, and never once
run.** One join executed it: **19 of 144 classes disagreed** between their save field set and their
load field set — a field written and never read back, or read and never written — and a further
**77 classes had save rows and no load rows at all.** For a project whose stated recovery target was
the save format, those were the highest-value rows in the artifact and nobody had looked.

**A cross-check that is described but never executed is a claim, not a check.** When a producer's
header advertises one, run it in the same round, print the number, and treat any disagreement as
either a probe defect or a genuine asymmetry — both worth a round.

## When a self-checking witness disagrees with itself, price the INSTRUMENT first

Some witnesses come in matched pairs that must agree — a serializer and its deserializer, a
constructor and its destructor, a writer and its reader. Running that comparison is always worth it
(see *a built-in cross-check must be MEASURED, not admired*). What to do with the failures is the
part that goes wrong.

The temptation is to read every disagreement as a finding about the BINARY: a field written and
never read back, an allocation never freed. **Enumerate your own instrument's failure modes first.**
They are a short list, you already know them, and they are far more likely.

**Measured.** A cross-check over 144 classes found **19 disagreements**, recorded as the artifact's
highest-value rows and as candidate format bugs. Reading the bodies: **18 of 19 were the probe's own
limits, and 0 were a genuine write-without-read.**

- **The access is one call deep.** A checked-read helper — `fread(dst,4,1,f)` plus an error bail —
  had **32 call sites**. A scanner that walks each body's own instructions cannot see a read
  performed by a callee, by construction.
- **The value passes through a local.** `tmp = [this+0x1f8] + [this+0x78]; fwrite(&tmp,…)` reads a
  field and writes a stack slot, so the field never appears as a written field. Same for unit
  conversions (`ticks * 1/60`) on the way out and back.
- **A branch is flattened into a set.** A record whose writer branches on a status byte contributes
  the UNION of both arms, which no single reader path will ever match.

All three are one shape: **the field access and the I/O call are not the same instruction.** If your
witness assumes they are, say so in its header, because every disagreement it reports is that
assumption failing before it is anything about the binary.

**And the messiest row can be the only real one.** The single genuine finding in those 19 was the
case that looked most like noise — a discriminated union keyed on an object's status, which a
reimplementation must reproduce. Do not rank rows by tidiness.

## Collapse a population by its shared witness BEFORE investigating any member

A population defined by a negative — *"77 classes have save records and no load records"* — reads as
N investigations and a coverage gap. Check what its members SHARE first; a uniform population is one
question wearing N hats.

**Measured.** Those 77 shared exactly one slot-45 target and one slot-46 target: a single inherited
pair. So it was never 77 questions. And the one question — *why would a base deserializer
legitimately be EMPTY?* — exposed an entire unexamined layer of the file format: the base serializer
writes the object HEADER (type id, handle, parent), and the base deserializer is empty **because the
object cannot read its own type id — you need the id before you have an object to read into.** The
header is consumed by a container above the per-object pair.

- **Group by the witness, not by the members.** One join answered it; 77 readings would not have.
- **An empty inherited method is a design statement, not an omission.** The emptiness names a
  boundary — here, between an object and its container — and points at whatever is on the other side
  of it. That container is where a file format's STRUCTURE lives (framing, null markers, type
  dispatch, pointer fixup), and it is the half that cannot be inferred from field lists.

## A forbidden column does not error — it returns a plausible wrong answer

Projects accumulate columns that are known-bad and marked *do not use*: a deprecated heuristic, a
superseded attribution, a field kept only for history. The prohibition lives in a document; the
column keeps sitting in the CSV, correctly typed and fully populated.

**Measured.** A grouping keyed on such a column returned *"72 of them have no entry"*; keyed on the
correct column the answer was *"all 77 share one entry"*. Nothing failed, nothing warned, and the
wrong answer was the right shape and the right order of magnitude.

- **Cross-check a surprising count against a number the same artifact already prints.** This one was
  caught only because *"72 with no slot-46 target"* contradicted the producer's own headline,
  *"224 tables with a slot-46 target"*, three lines up in its output.
- If a column must not be used, the durable fix is to make reading it loud — drop it from the
  regenerated artifact, or rename it `deprecated_*` so a join on the old name raises a `KeyError`
  instead of quietly succeeding.

## A backlog is made of things already NOTICED — budget "loose ends" as exploration

The finding that reframes a subsystem is structurally not on your open-items list, because every
item on it is something a previous round SAW and deferred. The thing nobody saw is not there.

**Measured.** Four items were logged after a round as tidy-up: two unnamed helpers, an unexplained
constant array, an unidentified predicate. Closing them cost four function bodies and produced the
arc's most consequential fact about the file format under study — one that changed what a
reimplementation would have to do, and that appeared on no list. It was reached only because closing
item 1 required finding a counterpart function, which nobody had opened.

- **Open the NEIGHBOURS of what you are closing**, not just the item. Callers, counterparts, the
  function next to it in the address space.
- **Do not schedule a loose-ends round as a chore and time-box it accordingly.** Its expected value
  is not the items; it is the unlabelled region you have to cross to reach them.

## A defect recorded as a property of one TOOL is a hypothesis about every tool that reads the same kind of thing

A project documented, at length and correctly, that a **printable-run scanner cannot observe where
a string STARTS** — only its NUL terminator is a real boundary — because a preceding float
constant's printable low byte silently prefixes the real name. That defect hid two class names for
**eleven rounds**, and the write-up was thorough: the mechanism, the two names, the bounded-suffix
fix, the cost.

It was filed under the tool that taught it. Nobody asked whether the *disassembler* had the same
blind spot. It does: **71 of 2975 defined strings in the same binary start one or two bytes early**,
absorbing the previous literal's tail, so the code's reference lands strictly INSIDE the datum and
the string reads as *referenced by nothing* — which is precisely the signal a naming round uses to
write a literal off as dead. Same defect, different instrument, one sweep to find, and it sat
unexamined for months beside a document describing it.

**When a round writes up a blind spot, name the CLASS of instrument it applies to, then spend one
probe asking each of the others.** The lesson generalises by *what is being read* (byte runs,
string data, symbol tables, relocation entries), not by which tool happened to expose it. The
question is cheap and the alternative is a correct write-up that protects exactly one code path.

## A guard on the CELL cannot compensate for a wrong POPULATION — and the cell guard is what hides it

A propagator was written to copy a base class's new fields into the descendants that carry a
flattened copy of its layout. Its population rule was *"any struct at least as long as the base
that differs at these offsets"*. That is not "flattened copies of the base"; it is **every class
with bytes at those addresses**. The dry run swept in 19 unrelated classes and 84 cells.

It had a second, correct guard: never overwrite a cell holding a decided name, only a placeholder.
That guard **refused 49 cells in the bad run**, and the refusals were the loudest thing in the
output. Every one of them was true. The run therefore *read as a guard doing its job* — and the
84 cells that sailed through were never printed, because nothing was wrong with them individually.

Two rules come out of this:

- **When a check refuses a lot and the round feels safe, ask what the refusals are a sample OF.**
  A high refusal count over the wrong denominator is evidence of a bad population, not of a good
  guard. Refusal counts are a property of the population you fed in.
- **Put the population rule where it can be tested without the analysis tool running.** Parentage,
  descendant sets, and classification are pure functions over data you already have. Moved into a
  plain-language library with its own poisons, the rule above is one test case — and the test can
  be written from the exact wrong classes the bad run produced, which is a far better fixture than
  anything invented.

## Classify against the state BEFORE the change you are propagating

A repair that copies a base's new members into stale copies has an ordering trap that is invisible
from inside it. Classification asks *"how much of the base does this descendant model?"* — and
adding 7 members to the base takes a descendant from 98-of-102 to 98-of-109, i.e. from
**FLATTENED to PARTIAL**. A rule that classifies against the post-change base therefore
**excludes exactly the classes that need repairing**, and reports a clean population while the
drift it exists to fix sits untouched.

The fix is to exclude the pending change from the denominator: classify against the base's members
*minus the ones being propagated*. It costs one parameter and it is the difference between a
repair that runs and one that silently no-ops.

## An apply whose own writes change what the next census can see should be run to CONVERGENCE

Replacing a 484-byte placeholder with a 4-byte member leaves 480 bytes reverting to single-byte
undefined fillers — and those fillers are *visible to the next pass's query* where the original
blob was not. So a second run of the same applier legitimately finds work the first could not
reach: 44 cells, then 8, then 0.

"Write a multi-step apply to converge rather than assume" is usually read as advice about analyzer
cascades. It applies just as much to an applier whose writes alter the shape its own census reads.
**Run it until it reports zero, and record the per-pass counts** — a single pass that "finished"
is indistinguishable from one that stopped early.

### A read-only round that writes no artifact cannot be distinguished from a round that never ran

**Measured, and it cost a whole round.** A read-only round recovered a type's size and field count
from two return-buffer spans, applied nothing, and wrote no artifact — deliberately and correctly,
because the artifact in question was a *decided* one whose rows require sign-off, not a side effect
of a read. The finding went into the round's notes file and nowhere else.

Seventy-one rounds later, two *other* notes files still asserted the type was unmeasured. A new
round priced itself the way this skill prescribes — **check the committed artifacts before
believing a note** — and the grep returned the type in six artifacts, every hit derived from its
mangled name and none from any layout or size file. That is precisely what *"named by three
manglings and nothing else"* predicts, so the pricing check **agreed with the stale claim** and the
round proceeded to re-derive an answer the project already had.

The stale sentence is not the defect; stale sentences are why the pricing check exists. **The
defect is that the check and the stale claim shared a blind spot**, so running it produced false
confidence rather than no confidence.

- **A read-only finding is only as durable as the cheapest thing that can contradict it.** When a
  round decides not to write an artifact — often the right call — it should record *where the
  finding lives and what would contradict it*, so a later "this is unmeasured" claim is falsifiable
  by searching the notes, not only the artifacts.
- **Give the verdict a name and use it.** If your project already distinguishes *"recorded by
  harvested evidence"* from *"recorded only by our own ledger"*, this is the next rung down —
  **recorded only by prose** — and it is the weakest, because a ledger is machine-readable and a
  paragraph is not.
- **When two records disagree, believe neither until you have opened the body.** Here the two
  loud claims were wrong and the quiet findings file was right. What settled it was reading four
  function bodies. The body-first rule is usually stated as *how you find a layout*; it is also
  **how you adjudicate a project against itself**.
- The round is still worth writing up, **at the original lead's location** rather than as a fresh
  finding — otherwise the next reader sees two independent-looking discoveries of one fact.

### Hand-rolled dataflow over a branching body fails in four ways, and they look like four bugs

**Measured across four iterations of one probe**, each fix revealing the next. The task was
ordinary: work out which of three accumulators feeds each field of a struct written by a large
function with three exit paths. All four failures are the *same* underlying mistake — treating a
branching body as if it ran straight through — and none of them announces itself:

- **Duck-typed operand values.** `getOpObjects` returns `Register` objects, and `Register` has
  `getOffset()`. An extractor accepting anything with `getValue`/`getUnsignedValue`/`getOffset`
  silently reads register encodings as instruction constants. Measured: a block-copy stride came
  out **8** against a true 16, and a store-offset set as `{12, 24}` against `{0,4,8,12}`. Filter
  to the scalar type explicitly.
- **Address order is not execution order.** A linear register-binding walk passes through the
  branch that is the *alternative* to the one that established a binding, and clobbers it — so
  the values read at a store belong to a path that was never taken to reach it.
- **A stack displacement only names a slot at a known stack pointer.** Arguments pushed between
  a value's production and its use shift the frame, so the same textual displacement denotes two
  different slots in one function. Adding frame tracking fixed one path and broke another.
- **Decompiler variable names are reused across exit paths.** A whole-function
  `variable → source` map keeps only the last assignment and silently blends paths.

**Every one was caught by a structural check and none by inspection.** The checks that did it
were cheap and worth copying: *three mechanically different witnesses of the same size must
agree*; *the four fields must divide 1 + 1 + 2 over three categories*; *the separate exit paths
must agree with each other*. Note what those have in common — they constrain the SHAPE of the
answer, independently of the mechanism producing it, so a broken instrument reads as a
contradiction rather than as a surprising result.

The corollary is the reassuring one: **the answer was identical on every run where the
instrument was sound.** When a structural check fires, suspect the instrument first; when it
passes across independent derivations, the result is worth more than any single clean run.

**And the resolution was to stop.** The decompiler already performs this analysis and resolves
all four problems by construction. "Check for a built-in before writing your own" applied from
the first line and was reached only after four iterations — the cost of hand-rolling is rarely
the first version, it is the three that follow.

### A NOT-TAKEN inherited from an older round is a claim, and inherits its staleness

**Measured, and one round after the same project had written up the identical failure.** A round
closed with a NOT-TAKEN copied verbatim from a round 70-odd earlier: *"this needs table X laid
out — still open, and tool Y still not consulted."* Three clauses, all false. The table had been
laid out fifty rounds before; the address quoted as the table's base was a **field inside its
records**; and tool Y described a different structure entirely.

Nothing about the sentence looked stale, because a NOT-TAKEN is written in the present tense and
carries the authority of the round that first recorded it. Copying one forward is the cheapest
possible way to end a write-up and the easiest place for a decayed claim to survive.

- **Re-check each clause of an inherited NOT-TAKEN against the program and the artifacts before
  repeating it** — the same pricing you would do before scoping a round from it, because that is
  exactly what the next reader will use it for.
- **Writing the lesson down does not change the next round's behaviour.** This project had
  documented the identical staleness one round earlier, in the same session. What catches it is a
  *step* in the write-up, not a principle in a file.

### Scope a branch at the next branch, not at a fixed instruction count

**Measured.** A probe needed to know which slot each of three category bits writes to. The body
is three consecutive blocks of the form `TEST reg, <bit>; JZ next; MOV [obj + slot], val`. The
probe looked for the first qualifying store within a fixed window of instructions after each
test — and the window from the second test reached into the *third* block, attributing that
block's store to the second bit. It reported one bit as owning two slots, and the structural
check ("each bit owns a known set") is the only thing that caught it.

A branch ends exactly where the next branch begins. Look for that boundary rather than guessing
a distance: **stop the scan at the next instruction of the same discriminating shape.** Any fixed
window is either too short for one arm or too long for another, and the failure is silent because
a too-long window still finds *a* plausible answer.

Two companions from the same probe, both worth stealing:

- **Expect a SET, not a value, wherever the code may legitimately write more than one slot.** The
  arm category owned two slots (`if (Arm0 == v) Arm0 = v; else Arm1 = v;`). An expectation
  written as a single offset reported a false conflict; written as a set it became a *stronger*
  claim — the bit must reach **both**.
- **Do not extract a scaled-index multiplier by splitting the operand text on `*`.** The scale is
  not among the operand objects, so it must come from the text — but a naive split returns the
  displacement. Anchor a narrow regex on the base you already know: `\*\s*0x([0-9a-f]+)`.

### Build the cheap probe to refute a guess even when you expect it to fail

**Measured, and the refutation was worth more than the guess would have been.** Two adjacent
400-byte blocks in one class, the first already established as an array of 16-byte records. The
obvious hypothesis was that the second was another one. A short probe refuted it in one run —
the region shows a distinct offset at every 4-byte step, i.e. individual fields.

But the probe also printed **which functions touch the region**, and four of them were an
`Add`/`Get`/`Remove`/`Reset` quartet naming the block explicitly. That identified the structure
immediately, and nothing in the project's notes had pointed at it. The round that followed
settled the whole thing on six witnesses.

- **A probe that reports only whether the guess held is worth much less than one that reports
  what it saw.** Print the population, the names, the distribution — the material that lets a
  reader form the *next* hypothesis. The verdict line is the least valuable thing in the output.
- **Function names are evidence.** Where a binary retains them, "who touches this region" is
  often a sharper instrument than any structural inference over the bytes.
- And keep the calibration arm: the same probe's first two versions could not see the *known*
  array either, so a bare "nothing touches +0x1e0" would have been a fact about the probe.

## A bijection closes over the two sides it was given — ask what could be in NEITHER

A join that reconciles perfectly in both directions is the most convincing form a census can take,
and it is a bare count wearing a proof's clothing. `A ∩ B = A = B, zero residue` establishes that
your artifact and your probe agree. It establishes **nothing** about a population outside both.

Measured (1999 MSVC/x86 game, toolbar button descriptors). One round reported
`77 ∩ 77 = 77, zero residue in both directions` between a committed CSV and the call sites of the
constructor that registers those buttons; a later session re-verified it independently; an applier
re-derived it a third time. All three were correct. The conclusion drawn from it — that the button
vocabulary was closed — was wrong: **97** such objects exist. The join compared the artifact against
**the one registrar that had produced the artifact**, and two sibling registrars — *identified by
the same round, in the same findings file* — supply the other 20.

Nothing in the join could have found this. It surfaced only by accident, when applying the recovered
type made an unrelated function legible and that function was seen comparing its argument against
six descriptors that appear in no artifact.

- **Before believing a bijection, name the mechanism that could produce a member of neither set.**
  Here: "is this the only registrar?" — one `getReferencesTo` on each sibling, and the round's own
  notes already listed them.
- **State the DENOMINATOR the join covers, not just the residue.** "77 of 97 descriptors" is the
  honest form; "zero residue in both directions" is true and misleading. This is the
  coverage-as-a-fraction rule from `SKILL.md` applied to joins, and a bijection is the most
  persuasive possible way to state a bare count.
- **A perfect join between an artifact and its own producer is a REPRODUCIBILITY check, not a
  coverage check.** Those are different claims and only one of them is usually the one being made.

## Parse operand OBJECTS, never the rendered instruction text

Two instrument defects in one round, both from reading Ghidra's *printed* form of an instruction
instead of its structured operands, and both producing a confidently absurd number:

- **A `CALL`'s target is not a `Scalar`.** A check that collected `Scalar` operands and looked for
  `fwrite`'s address among them reported **0** calls in a body that plainly makes three. Call
  destinations come from `ins.getFlows()` when `ins.getFlowType().isCall()`.
- **An absolute store is not a member write.** A check that found member offsets by splitting
  `getDefaultOperandRepresentation(0)` on `+` and taking any `0x…` piece read the absolute
  destination `[0x00577190]` as an offset of `+0x577190`, and concluded the object was 5.7 MB. The
  discriminator is structural, not textual: a `[reg + K]` write has a `Register` among its operand
  objects; an absolute one does not.

Related, same round: a body scan bounded at a guessed instruction count (24) cut a 29-instruction
function short and lost its third call. **Bound a body scan at the `RET`** —
`ins.getFlowType().isTerminal()` — not at a number you picked.

The rendered text is a *presentation*: it varies by processor module, by operand-display options,
and by whether a reference has been applied to the operand. `getOpObjects(i)`, `getFlows()`,
`getFlowType()` and `getReferencesFrom()` are the interfaces that mean what they say.

## "Blocked" is a claim about the binary — price it against the binary, not against your notes

A NOT-TAKEN entry that reads *"blocked, the evidence isn't recoverable"* is the entry that stops a
later round from even looking. It is therefore the one that most needs to be right, and it is
routinely the one written with the least work — because concluding that something is impossible
feels like it needs no measurement.

Measured. A round recorded a whole family of five record layouts as un-appliable, correctly
observing that the write-up of the investigation which had recovered them contained corrections but
no layout tables. Two of the five were genuinely gone. The third was not: **two function bodies
between them witnessed all twelve of its fields**, including one — a buffer capacity — that appeared
in no note anywhere. The cost of finding that out was two decompiles; the cost of not finding it out
was a backlog entry telling every future session not to bother.

> **"The evidence is not in the repo" and "the evidence cannot be obtained" are different
> statements.** Writing the first and recording the second is the specific error, and it is easy to
> make because the two produce identical-looking backlog prose.

The rule: **a "blocked" verdict owes one body read** — not a full recovery, just enough to
distinguish *nobody wrote this down* from *this is not in the binary*. This is the read-the-body
rule stated as a negative: read a body before concluding a thing cannot be recovered.

## For interchangeable fields, ask what a PERMUTATION would break

Size checks, bounds checks and tiling checks all validate a layout's SHAPE. None of them can see a
layout whose shape is right and whose field ORDER is wrong — and that failure is available whenever
a struct contains several fields of the same width holding the same kind of thing.

Measured: a 0x24-byte archive record whose five middle fields are all pointers to parsed chunk
buffers. Transposing any two of them yields a struct that tiles perfectly, passes every size and
bounds assertion, decompiles without complaint, and is wrong. Nothing structural distinguishes
them. The only evidence for the order is the code that assigns each one — here, following each
chunk's four-character container id to the field it is stored into.

- **For every group of structurally identical fields, ask what a permutation of them would break.**
  If the answer is "nothing", the layout is under-determined and the ordering check is not
  ceremony — it is the only evidence the order has. Its poison arm should transpose exactly two.
- The same question applies to array-of-struct field plans, to parallel arrays indexed by the same
  key, and to any `{a, b}` pair of the same type where the names are the whole distinction.

## Pair instructions on dataflow, never on proximity

"The next X after Y" is a guess about code layout wearing the clothes of an analysis. It fails
silently the moment anything else emits an X in between, and the failure looks like a finding.

Measured: a check mapping each container chunk id to the struct field it is stored into paired the
tag's `PUSH` with the next member store in address order. Every tag resolved to the same field,
because the constructor ZEROES all five fields immediately after the first tag reference. Arming
instead on the call that actually produces the stored value — the allocator — and taking the store
of *its* result resolved all five correctly.

Related shapes from the same project: scoping a branch at a fixed instruction count runs one
`TEST`/`JZ`/`MOV` block into the next; bounding a body scan at a guessed instruction count truncates
a 29-instruction function at 24 and loses its third call (bound at the `RET`:
`getFlowType().isTerminal()`).

> **When you associate two instructions, name the dataflow that links them.** If you cannot, the
> association is positional, and positional associations need a stated reason why nothing can come
> between.

## `this[-1].last_member` is the array cookie, not a use of the last member

A sweep that finds member uses by grepping decompiled C for a placeholder field name
(`this->m_0x2cc`, `this->field_0x54`) will attribute a **false witness to every class's LAST
member**, and it will look like one of the most authoritative witnesses in the harvest.

The mechanism is MSVC's array cookie. A `vector_deleting_dtor` recovers the allocation base as
`(char *)this - 4`, and the decompiler — knowing only the applied struct — spells that as the last
member of the *previous* array element:

```c
dVar1 = this[-1].m_0x3a0;                       /* sizeof(CVehicle) == 0x3a4 */
arena_free((int)&this[-1].m_0x3a0);
return (CVehicle *)&this[-1].m_0x3a0;
```

Nothing here touches `+0x3a0`. `&this[-1].m_0x3a0` is `this - 0x3a4 + 0x3a0`, i.e. `this - 4`.
The same artifact appears with an added constant when the last member is not flush with the end
(`this[-1].m_0x14c + 0x3c`, `sizeof == 0x18c`), and it also turns up in a copy `operator=`
(`param_1 = (T *)((int)&param_1[-1].m_0x3a0 + 3)`).

**Why it is dangerous rather than merely wrong.** The destructor is a body a naming round *wants*
to believe: it is the class's own method, it is short, and a field it touches looks like a real
member with a lifetime. So the false witness lands on the offset with the fewest genuine witnesses
— the tail of the object — and it lands there wearing the strongest-looking evidence in the file.

**The test is textual and cheap: reject any match whose prefix contains a negative index**
(`\[-\d+\]`). **Mark the rows, do not drop them** — a dropped row is invisible and the next reader
re-derives the same false witness; a marked one shows why the count moved.

Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary, over 1350 member-use rows across four classes: **7 rows, at
exactly 2 offsets, and both were their class's last member.** Small, bounded, and it had already
been reported as a finding by a reader who did not know it was an artifact.

### The same fiction hides an array — and this direction is the expensive one

The array cookie *adds* a false witness. The other rendering artifact *removes* true ones, which is
worse, because a missing witness reads as a measured zero and gets written off.

When a computed address is based on a component, the decompiler renders the access relative to
**that** component with a displacement:

```c
*(HGOBJECT *)(this->m_0x14c + iVar4 * 4 + -0x30) = param_1;   /* SetHomeUnit */
```

That is not a use of `+0x14c`. It is element `iVar4` of an `HGOBJECT[4]` at `+0x11c`
(`0x14c - 0x30`), and the disassembly says so plainly — `MOV [ECX+EDX*0x4+0x118],EAX`. So the
damage runs both ways: the charged component is **inflated** with rows that are not its, and the
array's own offsets read as *"nothing but the constructor touches them"* and are refused under a
zero-init guard.

**Measured on the same corpus: 5 of 1350 rows, 2 offsets, 1 of 4 classes** — and on that project it
was the difference between three refusals and a recovered four-element array plus two more
resolved blocks. A round brief written from the un-resolved index had *predicted* those three
offsets as refusals; a reader who went to the disassembly refuted it.

**Resolve, do not merely flag.** The displacement is a literal in the text, so
`base + disp` is computable and the row can be charged to the offset it actually reaches, with the
original charge recorded. That converts the defect into the instrument's best feature: a text-level
scan that *finds arrays*. A resolved row still earns a disassembly check before it is believed —
the rendering is evidence an array is there, not proof of its extent.

### And an ARRAY-typed component is invisible to a member-token grep entirely

A third shape, found in the same round by a third reader. A component typed as an array is not
assignable in C, so where a copy constructor renders every scalar member as its own token —

```c
this->Render.m_0x34 = param_1->Render.m_0x34;
this->Render.m_0x3c = param_1->Render.m_0x3c;
```

— the array member between them is copied as a block, or not rendered at all. The scan sees the
neighbours and not the field, and the result is the cleanest-looking zero in the harvest: the
offset has *no* row, in a struct where every neighbour has eight.

Measured: one offset, `+0x38` of a 76-byte embedded class, declared `byte[4]`. Its neighbours
`+0x34` and `+0x3c` each had 8 referencing bodies; it had none. The reader who resolved it found it
copied by three copy constructors and read **four times per frame** by the companion DLL, as the
argument of two exported virtuals. It was the round's most-used field and the instrument's flattest
zero.

Note the self-inflicted part: the component was typed as an array **by an earlier round of the same
project**, which declared the 4 bytes it could not attribute rather than dropping them. That was
right. But a defensive type applied to an unknown region then made the region invisible to the next
instrument that went looking — so **check what your own earlier applies did to the shape of the
thing you are now scanning.**

## A setter names a CELL, not a function — and setters write bookkeeping beside the datum

The standard field-naming route pairs an exported accessor with the offset its body writes:
`SetFoo` writes `[this+K]`, therefore `K` is `Foo`. It is one of the highest-yield naming routes
there is, and its failure mode is specific and quiet: **a setter routinely touches more than one
cell**, and the rule charges the noun to whichever one it picked.

**Measured.** Four field names came from four setters on one pass. A later round distrusted all four
and demoted them, on the stated grounds that the bodies were **too short to be a sufficient witness**
— 23, 30, 55 and 134 instructions. Re-examined against the program:

| setter | length | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `SetCommander` | 23 | correct — promoted on a consumer join |
| `SetAlpha` | 30 | **wrong cell** — the value goes elsewhere; the charged cell is a *reference count* the setter increments |
| `SetPosition` | 55 | correct — promoted on two reading bodies |
| `SetTarget` | 134 | **wrong cell** — the target is an inherited member the body also writes; the charged cell is a *one-shot latch* tested and cleared in the prologue |

**The shortest was right and the two longest were wrong**, so the discriminator was not merely weak
— on this population it was anti-correlated, because a longer setter has more cells for the noun to
be charged to the wrong one of.

**The rule.** The question an accessor-derived name has to answer is not *"is this body a big enough
witness"* but ***"does the setter's noun denote the cell the rule charged it to"*** — and that is
answerable only by reading the body. Expect at least these three shapes beside the datum:

- a **counter** the setter increments and a matching `ClearFoo`/`ReleaseFoo` decrements, with the
  resource torn down at zero. Acquire / release / detach-at-zero is a reference count, whatever the
  setter is called;
- a **latch or dirty flag** written on one branch and consumed elsewhere — often in the *prologue* of
  the same function, which makes it look like the function's own subject;
- the **datum's real home in a base class**, already named by an earlier round, with the setter
  writing a derived-class mirror or scratch copy as well.

Two cheap checks that would have caught both errors before either name was applied. **Read the
matched inverse** — `ClearFoo`, `ResetFoo`, `GetFoo` — because a pair discriminates where a single
body does not; `ClearAlpha` was twelve instructions and settled the question outright. And **look
for an already-decided cell that the noun fits better**: `Target` was applied to a class that already
carried a decided `TargetHandle` at an inherited offset, so the emitted struct ended up with two
targets. A naming route should refuse, or at least flag, a noun that duplicates a decided member of
the same object.

**Corollary for the demotion tier.** If your project has a tier meaning *"applied, but the evidence
was judged insufficient"*, note what it does and does not protect. It protects the name from being
destroyed by a rebuild. It does **not** stop the name reaching an emitted header, a struct, or a
reader — so a name later measured to be on the *wrong cell* is a defect with a mutating fix, not a
row that can be left sitting in the demoted tier.


## A witness kind can be UNANSWERABLE, and a null then means the opposite of what it reads

`confidence=none` reads as *"nobody has looked yet"*. It can also mean *"this instrument cannot look
here"*, and the two are indistinguishable in the artifact. Measured: a round inherited the question
*"does this function's body use register ECX as an object pointer?"* from the previous round's own
abstention text. Every one of its 27 subjects turned out to be a **one- or two-instruction stub** that
touches ECX not at all. The question is not unanswered for them — it is **unanswerable**, because
there is no instruction to read. A producer built on the inherited framing would have returned 27
honest nulls, and every later round would have read them as an unworked backlog.

**Check that the question is answerable where you intend to point the instrument, before building
it.** Four function bodies opened by hand settled this in minutes, before any producer existed. This
is why *read the body first* is a rule and not a preference.

**When the subject cannot testify, look for a witness about its CALLERS or its CONTEXT.** For a
virtual function the dispatch site binds every implementation of that slot: if any *other*
implementation of the same slot demonstrably uses the register as an object, the call site must load
it, and every override reachable there receives it — including a stub that ignores it. The evidence
is about the call, not the callee, which is exactly why it works where the body does not.

**Corroborate a structural grouping you invented with a byte-level invariant it predicts.** That slot
witness depends on a guess about which vtables belong to one class family (agreement on a fraction of
common slots). The callee-cleanup byte count in each `RET` is an independent prediction of that
grouping — every implementation of one slot *must* pop the same number, because the caller pushes one
argument list and cannot know which override it reaches. Where the group agreed, the grouping was
corroborated from the bytes; where it disagreed, the row abstained. **Do not report the witness and
the grouping as one number.**

## Design a census artifact to SURVIVE the apply it justifies

A census keyed on *"the population still needing work"* deletes itself as the work is done. Measured:
an artifact keyed on the residual blind bucket would have shrunk from 34 rows to 11 the moment its
apply landed — **discarding the recorded witness for every function it had just justified**, leaving
the round's central claim provable only from a commit message.

Key it on **the residual population UNION the round's own ledger**. The ledger supplies *addresses
only*; every witness column is still measured from the program, so this is not reading your own
conclusions back as evidence. Add a verdict value for *already applied*, and a check that **refuses if
a ledgered row would no longer qualify under today's rules** — otherwise the applied rows become a
free pass and a later change to the rule silently exempts exactly the population it should re-grade.

The measurable payoff: across the apply, **every byte-derived count held identically** and only the
verdict census moved. **An artifact whose numbers survive its own apply is a regression detector; one
that must be re-pinned every round is a snapshot.**
## Match the SCOPE of a measure to the scope of the question

A similarity measure over a whole structure is the wrong instrument for a question about one element
of it, and the failure is quiet because the number looks reasonable.

Measured, on vtables. The question was *"do these two classes mean the same method at slot N?"*; the
rule answered *"do their tables agree on ≥50% of all common slots?"*. That statistic is dominated by
the shared **base prefix** — every class in a hierarchy copies its base's entries — so it stays high
for two classes that diverged long before slot N. A 223-slot table was grouped with five 184-slot
ones at 51–53% agreement that agree with it on **0%** of the slots near the slot in question. Their
slot N held a different method, and the callee-cleanup byte counts proved it.

**And the obvious fix failed in the opposite direction, which is why it needs its own failure
analysis.** Narrowing the same measure to the element's neighbourhood is too STRICT wherever the
derived structure legitimately differs most: a class that overrides many neighbouring methods has
*low* local agreement with its own base **precisely because it is derived**. Two genuinely related
classes differed at 22 of 41 low slots. Swept over 20 (window, threshold) settings, the local rule
condemned the same row at **every one** — unanimity that read as a robust finding and was an artefact
of the flaw every setting shared.

**A fix to a heuristic is a new heuristic.** "It disagrees at every setting" is not robustness when
all the settings share one defect.

### Prefer recovered structure to a structural heuristic — and check whether you already have it

The sound test needed no threshold at all:

> element N means the same thing for two types iff N lies within the *declaring* ancestor — the
> nearest common ancestor whose own structure is large enough to contain it.

That is recovered **parentage** plus sizes, both of which the project had already committed months
earlier and neither of which the round used. It validates by inspection: a slot declared in the
38-entry root admits every one of its 38 descendants; a slot declared in the 47-entry intermediate
admits 67; a deep slot narrows to 1.

**Before inventing a structural heuristic, grep the evidence directory for an artifact that answers
the question directly.** The heuristic is the thing you build when the answer genuinely is not
recoverable — not the thing you build first.

**Report the recovered instrument's own coverage gap rather than absorbing it.** The hierarchy
mapped 244 of 296 tables; a subject in one of the other 52 gets an explicit `untestable` verdict
naming the gap, never a silent pass or a silent failure. Those two mean opposite things and a single
"no evidence" value hides which one you have.

### A shared NAME is not a parentage

The intuition that flagged the local rule as wrong was *"these two classes are obviously related,
look at their names"*. Their chains met only four and five links up. The intuition reached the right
conclusion by the wrong route, which is the hardest kind to catch: the slot was shared because it sat
inside the ROOT's table, and the shared prefix in the names was irrelevant. **When a naming intuition
contradicts a measurement, resolve it against the hierarchy artifact — do not let either win on
plausibility.**

### A trap fixed in one derivation is waiting in its siblings — audit a metric per column, not per tool

A project that reduces its progress to a handful of computed denominators has built something worth
auditing one column at a time, because each column is its own derivation and each can mean something
other than its definition. Measured on one project with four: the **fourth** column audited was the
fourth to fail, and it failed in the way the tool's own docstring had documented for the second.

- The tool said, of the size column, *"sizes live in FOUR producers and no single file is
  authoritative; a check reading one reports 280 unsized where the truth is 55"* — and poison-tested
  it. Three functions down, the layout column read **one** artifact of four and reported **12** where
  the truth was **205**. Nothing looked wrong: 12 is a plausible number, its rule was printed beside
  it, and a 282-class wave had been planned against it. **When a defect is documented for one
  derivation, grep the tool's own source for sibling derivations with the same shape** before
  believing any of them.
- **A metric's supporting sentence is a population claim, and one join checks it.** The plan said
  *"41 of the 55 are unnamed vftables; they need naming before they can be sized."* The tool's own
  join said 40; naming is not a prerequisite for sizing (the witness is an allocation); and 39 of the
  40 already carried an exact allocation size in a committed artifact the size deciders never read.
  The sentence stood a day; the check took a minute.
- **A boolean presence metric hits its target with one row per entity.** "Classes with a layout"
  needed two companions to mean anything: the entities laid out *by construction* (101 classes that
  add no storage to their base — a target of "every class" that counts them as missing can never be
  reached), and **coverage** — bytes of own storage under a field row, 56.6% there against "205 of
  294 present". Report presence and coverage apart; the second is what a wave plans against.
- **Keep the old rule reachable as the negative twin.** The legacy derivation stayed callable and
  became a fixture arm: the new rule must see what the old one could not, on a fixture where the old
  one demonstrably fails. That is the two-step diff for a definition change, and it is what makes
  "12 → 205" a repair rather than a relabel.

## Frequency over a corpus counts COPIES, and a corpus of assets is full of them

Ranking a work queue by how often something occurs across the shipped data is the obvious
prioritisation, and it is right often enough to be trusted without checking. The failure is specific:
**a histogram over a corpus measures occurrences, and content is duplicated between corpus members
far more often than code is.**

*Observed in the third-party project `gmegidish/crux-re-claude`, whose `tools/opcode_usage.py`
carries the warning in its own docstring.* It histograms script opcodes across all 29 of the game's
scenes to rank which unimplemented ones the port should do next — and notes that a high count can
mean **duplicated debug code**: a give-all-items program written once and copied into every scene
inflates one opcode to 29 occurrences with a single author decision behind it.

The general shape, and it applies to any per-asset sweep, not just scripts:

- **A count over a corpus is `occurrences`; what you usually want is `distinct members that need
  it`.** Report both. `29 occurrences / 1 distinct origin` and `29 occurrences / 29 members` are the
  same number ranking opposite work, and only the second is a queue.
- **Duplication in a corpus is the norm, not a defect to fix.** Templates, per-level copies of a
  shared prologue, boilerplate emitted by a tool, and debug scaffolding left in every map all
  multiply one decision into N rows. This is the same instinct as the rule that coverage is stated
  as a **fraction of the population it claims to cover**, one level down: a bare count hides whether
  the denominator is authors or artifacts.
- **The cheap check is a hash, not an analysis.** Before believing a frequency ranking, group the
  containing records by content hash and see how much of the top of the histogram collapses. If it
  does, the ranking was measuring your corpus's copy-paste history.


## An index nothing populated answers like a measurement

A query tool over a derived index has two failure states that look identical to the caller and
neither is an error: the index is **absent** (the export did not finish) and the index is **empty**
(it finished and wrote nothing). Both must **refuse**, with different messages — collapsing them
tells the reader to re-export when the export is fine, or the reverse.

**Measured.** An offline corpus wrote two of its program-wide indexes as empty lists, under a
comment explaining that *a bounded trial* writes them empty. There was no trial branch, so the full
export did it too — for as long as the corpus had existed. The two commands built on those indexes
then printed nothing (exit 0) and `no recorded writer for <addr>` (exit 0), for a string with three
real referrers and a global with five real writers. Three of the seven evidence kinds the whole
delegation pipeline runs on were silently unserviceable, and any agent told "query the corpus
first" would have recorded absences that are not there.

> **A comment describing a branch is not a branch.** Grade the branch: if a conditional matters,
> there is a run of the tool in each arm that proves it.

**The independence of a second derivation is what makes this findable.** The same facts existed in a
committed artifact built by a different script for a different purpose. Deriving the index *from the
program* rather than from that artifact kept the two independent — and cross-checking them caught
**two** defects in the repair itself: a raw newline written unquoted (splitting one row into two,
one parsing with a punctuation mark as its address), and a collector that kept only code referrers
while its own docstring claimed the rest were counted. The tidier design — have the index read the
artifact — would have made them agree by construction and shipped both.

**Report the residue as a named column, not as a count.** After the repairs the two derivations
still differed on 71 of 2,972 rows. Every one of the 71 had a non-zero `true_offset` and an
`interior` reference shape in the artifact, and the raw value matched the artifact's *uncorrected*
column in 71 of 71 — one correction layer, fully explaining both the text and the referrer
differences. *"They differ on 71 values"* is a worry; *"they differ exactly where this column says
they should"* is a closed finding.

**And give an expensive producer a cheap re-run for the part that is cheap.** These indexes depend
on references and memory, not on the decompiler, but repairing them was costing a full 25-minute
re-export. A mode that rebuilds only them — refusing unless the on-disk export matches the live
program version, so it can never patch a stale cache into looking current — took 80 seconds, and
that is the difference between fixing both defects and recording one as a known issue.


## `git show` is not a byte comparison, and reaching for the local hazard to explain it is its own trap

Comparing a regenerated artifact against the committed one is the core move of any
regression check on a harvester. `git show HEAD:path` looks like the way to get the committed
bytes. It is not: it prints the **normalised blob**, after whatever clean filters and CRLF
conversion the repo is configured for.

Measured: a 5630-row CSV written by Windows-hosted Ghidra read **505179** bytes in the working
tree and **499548** from `git show`. That is a 5631-byte gap — one CR per line, header included —
and it looks exactly like a real content change on a file that had not changed at all.

**Compare with `git rev-parse HEAD:<path>` against `git hash-object <path>`.** Both apply the
same clean filter, so they agree exactly when the content agrees; both emit a single value, which
is the shape least likely to be mangled by whatever sits between you and the terminal.

The second half of this is the reasoning failure, and it is the more expensive one. The project
where this happened has a documented, real hazard in its own toolchain — an output-filtering
proxy that genuinely does rewrite some commands' output — and the first explanation reached for
was *"the proxy truncated it"*. Plausible, locally famous, and wrong. **A known hazard is a
hypothesis, not an explanation**, and a known hazard that would explain the anomaly is exactly
when to test rather than conclude: the test here was one command (`/usr/bin/git` directly, then
the byte arithmetic) and it took under a minute. Writing down a plausible mechanism as though it
were measured is how a project acquires a confident wrong answer that nothing later re-examines —
the anomaly is "explained", so nobody looks again.

## A backlog item is a claim; re-derive it when you pick it up, not when you doubt it

`SKILL.md`'s round zero says to keep *measured-zero* distinct from *not-yet-run*, because a
stale "unknown" reads as an opportunity forever. Here is that failure at project scale, and
the two habits that would have prevented it.

Measured on a 1999 MSVC/x86 binary. A backlog carried, across three session handoffs and two
notes files, *"a mangled-name string table at ~`0x005003xx` — a THIRD place the binary spells
class names, and nobody has looked at what it does cover"*, ranked as the highest-certainty
open naming source. It is not a third place. It is the **PE export directory's own name-string
pool** — the same names, seen as strings instead of as export records. Read by address range:
**977 strings, 977 already in the project's own exports artifact, 0 new.** The mechanism was
confirmed rather than assumed: each string carries exactly one data reference, from a
contiguous array of RVAs, with the strings in alphabetical order — the shape of the export
directory's `AddressOfNames` table.

Two things make this worth a rule rather than a shrug:

- **The refutation was already in the repo.** Another notes file recorded *"1970 export rows
  over 986 addresses; 976 addresses exported twice (mangled + undecorated)"*, and a third
  exploited that twin as a free demangler cross-check. The knowledge was present; the lead was
  written as though it were not. **Two prose files disagreeing is invisible** — nothing joins
  prose to prose, so a stale claim and its refutation can sit in the same tree for months.
- **Nobody had priced it, because inheriting it felt like knowing it.** The check cost one
  query against a file already committed. What kept it alive was that each session received it
  as a *stated fact* in a handoff and scheduled it rather than testing it.

**So: write the PREDICTED YIELD into the backlog item.** "Unswept source X" is not a task, it
is a noun; "unswept source X, expected to name ~N functions the export table does not" is a
task whose premise can be graded the moment someone picks it up — and would have been graded
false here in one step. Then, when you do pick it up, **re-derive the premise before scoping
the work**, not because you doubt it but because it is a claim and its age is not evidence.

## When a population has a POSITIONAL definition, do not select it with a PATTERN

Same round, and the instrument defect it walked into is worth its own line, because the
correct fix is not "write a better pattern".

The first two passes selected mangled names with a recalled regex,
`^\?[\w?$]+@[\w@?$]*@@[A-Z_0-9]`. It matched `??0AIPlayer@@QAE@ABV0@@Z` and **rejected**
`??0AIPlayer@@IAE@XZ` — identical prefixes, differing only in the signature tail. The match on
the first succeeded by backtracking so that `[\w@?$]*` swallowed `@QAE@ABV0` and the `@@` then
matched deep inside the *signature*, not the scope terminator. The regex was not measuring the
property it was named for at all. It reported 906 members of a 977-member population and
manufactured an unexplained 793-item gap that cost two further measurements to chase down.

The population had a positional definition all along — a contiguous address range — and
selecting by range removes the instrument from the answer entirely. A pattern is a *hypothesis
about the data*; it needs its own evidence before it can be used to gather evidence. Prefer,
in order: an address range or a table's own bounds; a set intersection against a committed
artifact; a census of the actual token vocabulary in the population; and only then a pattern.

## A queued item's stated BLOCKER is an untested premise too

A backlog item is a claim, and the claim that decays quietest is not *"this fact is still true"* —
it is ***"this is still what the item is waiting for."*** The item's facts get re-derived when
someone finally works it; its stated blocker gets copied forward verbatim, because it reads as
scoping rather than as a finding.

Measured. An item asking whether a function's first parameter, typed as an ancestor of the owning
class, should be narrowed to the owner had been queued for eight rounds and restated in three
handoffs as needing a specific new capability — offset-aware tracking of *call receivers*. It never
needed it. The question is about member **accesses**, not call **receivers**, and the witness for
it — how far any access through `this` reaches, compared with the declared type's known size — had
been produced by the existing scanner for over a hundred rounds. One probe over the whole
population: 79% of the rows met the condition immediately.

Two things follow, and the second is why this is cheap enough to be a rule:

- **When you pick up a queued item, re-derive the blocker before you build for it.** The item's
  author knew less than the project knows now, and nothing re-checks that sentence.
- **Testing a blocker is cheaper than testing a fact**, because it is a question about tools you
  already have rather than about the target. It is usually one probe over the item's own
  population, and it either closes the item or tells you the blocker is real.

The corollary for writing items: **say what the item needs in terms of the OBSERVATION, not the
mechanism.** "Needs a witness that the body touches bytes the declared type does not have" survives
contact with a changing toolbox; "needs offset-aware alias tracking" was wrong the day it was
written and read as authoritative for eight rounds.

## In a topological population, "contributes nothing" is not "can be skipped"

When a population is computed by fixpoint — build what you can, then build what that unblocked,
repeat — every node has two roles: what it contributes, and what it unblocks. A filter written
against the first quietly destroys the second.

Measured. A wave built structs for classes whose base was already built. The rule skipped any
class with a decided size, a built base and no recovered fields of its own, reasoning correctly
that it contributes zero components. That kept it out of the `built` set, so **every class derived
from it was refused for a base that could have been built** — one 184-byte class took its only
descendant down with it, and the wave reported a single pass where there were two.

The tell is that the skipped node looks *obviously* pointless in isolation, which is exactly why
nobody re-examines it. The fix was to build it with its own region left undefined: an undefined
region claims nothing, the inherited prefix is real, and the node stops being a hole in the graph.

**Before skipping a node for having no payload, ask what depends on it.** In a flat population
this costs nothing; in a topological one it silently truncates the result, and the missing items
are refused with a plausible-looking reason rather than being visibly absent.

## When a prerequisite turns out to be unobtainable, re-derive what the GOAL needed

A blocked task usually carries a stated prerequisite, and the prerequisite is usually a property
of the *method someone first imagined*, not of the goal. When it turns out to be unobtainable, the
reflex is to abandon the task or to go hunting for a stronger witness. Check first whether the
goal ever depended on it.

Measured, twice in four rounds on the same project. A struct-building wave was blocked on the size
of three base classes; investigation established those sizes are **genuinely unrecoverable** — a
base never allocated on its own only ever has `sizeof(derived)` materialised by the compiler, and
nothing observable lies inside the remaining window. The wave landed anyway, because the structs
are **flattened at absolute offsets**: a field at offset X sits at X whichever class owns it, so
the undecided base boundary changes *attribution*, not *layout*. Flattening from the nearest
ancestor that IS decided, and leaving the region above it undefined, asserted strictly less and
delivered the whole payoff. Separately, a signature-narrowing item had been queued for eight
rounds behind "needs offset-aware alias tracking"; the witness it actually needed had existed for
a hundred rounds and closed 79% of the population in one probe.

**The question to ask is not "how do I obtain the prerequisite" but "what does the deliverable
actually consume".** Those differ whenever the prerequisite was written down by someone sketching
one route.

The corollary for writing the item down in the first place: **state what the goal needs in terms
of the OBSERVATION, not the mechanism.** "Needs a prefix to flatten" survives contact with a
changing toolbox; "needs sizeof(immediate_base)" sends the next reader after a number nobody can
measure.

## A lookup that can answer "no" for a STRUCTURAL reason is a false zero waiting to happen

Type systems in reverse-engineering tools are namespaced, and the namespace is usually invisible in
the question you think you are asking. "Does this class have a struct?" looks like a yes/no about
the program. Implemented as a lookup in **one** category, it is a yes/no about *where the struct
happened to be created*.

Measured. A sweep asked for a type at the root category path. Structs the project itself builds
land there — so the lookup found every one of its own and looked healthy. Structs the tool's own
**demangler** builds land under a different category, and for those the answer was always "no". A
real 1124-byte structure, matching the class's independently decided size exactly, was reported as
absent, and 25 rows of a live population were refused for a reason that was not true.

Three things generalise beyond category paths:

- **Ask what a `no` could mean other than "absent".** A namespace not searched, a spelling not
  normalised, a population filtered before the join — each turns a lookup into a partial one whose
  negative answers are indistinguishable from real ones.
- **Assert the lookup finds SOMETHING.** A resolver that answers `no` for every row in a population
  whose members all satisfy a related, independently-established property (here: every owner had a
  decided size) is the instrument failing, not a finding. Key it on emptiness, not a threshold.
- **The direction of a partial lookup decides its severity.** A false `no` that only ever REFUSES
  is conservative — it withholds work and never corrupts it. A false `no` that admits, or that
  feeds a count someone quotes, is not. Say which yours is, because it is the difference between a
  round that lost 25 rows and a round that published a wrong number.

## The witness a round needs is often already in the scan output it is discarding

Before building a new instrument for a question, read the full return value of the one you are
already calling.

Measured. A round classified bodies by whether any class's vtable pointed at them, and the ones in
no vtable were written up — in the round record, the commit message and the applier's header — as
resting on the analyst's own attribution with nothing external corroborating them. That claim was
testable and wrong for most of the population. **39 of those 49 bodies were constructors and
destructors, which is precisely WHY no vtable slot points at them** — and a constructor *stores its
own class's vtable pointer through `this`*. The body-scanning helper had been returning exactly
that, in a field beside the one the sweep was reading, for dozens of rounds.

The general form: a scan that walks a body usually collects several facts at once (writes, reads,
calls, stores of known constants). A round asks for one of them and looks past the rest. **When a
round concludes "there is no independent witness here", grep the scanner's return keys before
believing it.**

Two riders. Report such a witness as a **floor, not coverage** — a non-constructor has no reason to
store a vtable, so a miss says nothing either way. And if the check arrives *after* the decision it
would have informed, **record that order**: a round that turns out well-evidenced in hindsight is
not the same as one that was well-evidenced when it acted, and the difference is exactly what a
later reader needs to calibrate the next approval.

## An OVERLAP is not a YIELD: pricing a round from a join instead of from the witness

The cheapest-looking way to price a round is a join between two committed artifacts: *"N classes
carrying M unknown bytes were also touched by the thing we just did — so M bytes are addressable."*
That number is an **overlap**, and an overlap is an upper bound with no lower bound attached.

Measured. A layout gap of 8,767 bytes over 75 classes was joined against the 23 classes a previous
round had just re-typed: 4,154 bytes, 47% — and that figure went into the recommendation. Actually
pointing the witness at those bodies covered **592 of 5,534 bytes (10.7%)**, and the single largest
target — a 784-byte span the round was scoped around — stayed **744/784 dark**, with half the
supposedly-relevant bodies touching *nothing* inside it.

The join was correct. It answered "do these populations intersect?" and was read as "how much would
the second recover from the first?" Those differ by however sparse the witness turns out to be, and
sparsity is exactly what you cannot see from the join.

- **Price with the instrument you would actually run**, over a sample if not the whole population.
  A probe that takes seconds beats a join that takes none.
- **Report the population size that feeds the witness**, not just the target size. In the case
  above, the classes scoring 0.0% had *one* method filed under them — the witness was under-fed,
  not weak, and the per-class method count made that visible at a glance where the percentage alone
  did not.
- **Put the price in the message that proposes the round.** A refutation costs nothing when it
  arrives before the work; it costs a decision when it arrives after someone has approved.

## A cross-check that cannot distinguish the subject is NO result, not a weak one

When a measurement comes back suggestive but the instrument cannot separate your subject from
something else, the honest report is "unusable", not a hedged number.

Measured. To test whether a 744-byte region of one class was touched anywhere, every function's
disassembly was searched for a memory displacement inside that byte range. It returned 57
functions — which looked like a promising lead until they were read: almost all belonged to a
*different, larger class* accessing its own objects at the same numeric offsets. A raw displacement
carries no type, so `+0xc6c` on one object is indistinguishable from `+0xc6c` on another.

The temptation is to report "57 functions, though some may be unrelated". Don't. **A number that
answers a different question is precisely the kind that gets quoted later as though it answered
this one** — the stale-denominator failure, seeded deliberately. Say the instrument cannot
distinguish the subject, give the reason, and report no count at all.

## A bucket label is a claim, and it is the one the reader acts on

Deriving a breakdown's counts and then hand-writing its category labels leaves the analysis half
done. Nobody scopes work from a bare number: they read the label, and the label is where an
unbacked claim about *cost* slips in beside a number that is genuinely measured.

Measured. A round replaced a stale hard-coded breakdown with a derived one — good — and labelled two
of its four buckets *"mechanical, named by contract"* and *"mechanical, named from its slot"*. Both
asserted a cheap naming route. Both routes had already been priced and refuted by that same
project: one of them by a probe whose header is literally titled *"Is this naming route real?"*,
which had found the rule structurally broken (a derived class's dispatch table is laid out as
`[base's slots][the derived class's own new virtuals]`, so sibling branches assign the same index to
unrelated methods **by construction**). The corrected form of that route had yielded **6** names
against a bucket the label called mechanical at **376**.

Three rules:

- **A count needs a derivation; a label needs a citation.** If a label implies work is cheap, name
  the measurement that says so. If no measurement exists, the label describes *what the rows are*,
  not *what they will cost*.
- **Before writing "mechanical", grep for the probe that priced it.** A project that prices routes
  tends to name those artifacts predictably (`diag_price_*`, `*_candidates.csv`); the refutation is
  usually one search away and a hundred sections old.
- **Prefer structural labels.** "In the static-initializer table" and "reached from a dispatch
  table" are facts that stay true. "Mechanical" is a forecast, and a forecast belongs in a round's
  pricing, not in a standing report.

The residue is worth stating positively: after the correction, the breakdown said three *kinds* of
function with **no cheap route known for any of them**. That is a more useful thing to hand the
next round than a false cheap/expensive split, because it changes the plan from "do the easy
half" to "this is body-read work or it is nothing".

## A secondary verdict on an excluded row reads as a lead

An evidence artifact that records two instruments side by side will be read one column at a time.
If the second instrument's verdict is populated on rows the first has already excluded, the verdict
column becomes a false lead for anyone who reaches it before the exclusion — and a citation that
quotes only the second instrument's counts guarantees they will.

Measured. A candidate census carried a structural test (*is this dispatch-table slot comparable
between these two classes at all?*) and, beside it, an independent body-side test (*do the two
bodies pop the same number of argument bytes?*). Every row failed the structural test and said so in
an `exclusion` column. The body-side column still read `agrees` on 27 of them — trivially, since
most bodies took no arguments. A report cited the file as "72 rows, 42 CONTRADICTS", and the next
session's handoff turned that into "27 agree, 6 were applied, 21 are waiting": the 6 had been
applied by a *different rule from a different population*, and a join by address showed the two
shared no row. The lead cost a round to refute and had never existed.

Three rules:

- **A subtraction across two artifacts is a join, not arithmetic.** Before "N candidates minus M
  applied", join by identity and count the intersection. If it is empty, so is the lead.
- **Render a secondary verdict conditional on the primary.** `agrees` on an excluded row is a
  coincidence; print it as one (*"27 carry an arity that agrees BY COINCIDENCE on a non-comparable
  row"*), and print a row that passes the primary test — should one ever appear — as a live lead
  rather than folding it into an aggregate.
- **Cite the column that closes the question, not the one that opens it.** Quoting the count of
  outright contradictions implies the remainder is open. Quote the exclusion count, or derive both
  in the report so the sentence beside them cannot drift.

The companion trap, from the same round: **the throwaway census is where a forbidden join key gets
used.** A column a project has banned from its *checks* was used in a "just pricing" join and
produced a clean-looking zero from a dead key — 149 of 149 shared bodies with no owner. Run the
positive control (the names the rule already applied must re-derive) before believing any zero, and
exclude pairs that agree by construction (a non-overriding subclass points at the *same* body as its
base) before quoting a calibration; the trivial pairs inflated one here by a factor of five.

### An address→function map built on STARTS alone never answers "no function"

A tool that resolves an address by bisecting over function start addresses returns the
nearest preceding start for every address — including addresses past the end of that
function, in padding, or at an undiscovered entry point — and calls the result the container.
It cannot say "no function" because it has no extents to say it with. Measured twice on one
project: an undiscovered entry point reported as `FUN_0048faa0 +0x90` (the neighbour ended
at `0x0048fb25`), and later a nine-row census of vtable slot targets recorded as "inside
another function's extent" when the program held every one inside NO function
(`getFunctionContaining == None`). The first was written up as a caveat; the second round
read the caveat inverted — *"ask the tool which function contains it"* — and the census
built on it stood until an applier re-derived the population from the program and got an
empty set. A prose caveat protected nobody; the repair was in the tool: containment now
comes from an extents source (an exported per-function size), an address past the end
answers `-` and names the function that ends before it, and the start-only bisect survives
only behind a flag whose output column is labelled `preceding`. **Anything that answers
"which function is this address in" must carry extents or say that it does not.** The exact
answer is always the program's `getFunctionContaining`, and a census that decides a
mutation's MECHANISM should ask the program, not a symbols file.
